Part 1
Narrator: You will hear a telephone conversation between a customer and a hotel receptionist. First, you have some time to look at questions 1 to 5.

Narrator: You will see that there is an example that has been done for you. On this occasion only, the conversation relating to this will be played first.

Receptionist: Good morning, Royal Grand Hotel, how may I help you?

Customer: Hello, good morning. I'm calling to inquire about room availability and facilities for a potential stay next month. Could you give me some information?

Receptionist: Of course, I'd be happy to assist you. We have several room types here at the Royal Grand. We have our Standard rooms, Deluxe rooms, and our spacious Suites.

Customer: Right. Could you tell me a little bit about the Standard rooms first?

Receptionist: Certainly. Our Standard rooms are well-appointed with a comfortable double bed, a private en-suite bathroom, and complimentary high-speed Wi-Fi access. These rooms are priced at £90 per night.

Narrator: The standard room price is £90, so ‘£90’ has been written in the table. Now we shall begin. You should answer the questions as you listen because you will not hear the recording a second time. Listen carefully and answer questions 1 to 5.

Customer: That sounds good for a basic room. What about the Deluxe rooms? What makes them different, and what's the price?

Receptionist: Our Deluxe rooms offer a bit more luxury and space. They also come with a double bed, private bathroom, and free Wi-Fi, naturally. Additionally, these rooms feature a small sitting area where you can relax, and many of them boast a lovely balcony with views of the city. The Deluxe rooms are priced at 125 pounds per night.

Customer: A sitting area and a balcony sound very appealing. And what about your top-tier Suites?

Receptionist: Our Suites are designed for ultimate comfort and spacious living. Besides the double bed, en-suite bathroom, and Wi-Fi, they include a convenient kitchenette, ideal for preparing light meals. Furthermore, each suite features a separate lounge area for entertaining or relaxing, and a large flat-screen TV. They are priced at 180 pounds per night.

Customer: Wow, a kitchenette and a lounge. That's impressive. I'm looking to book for the weekend of the 15th to the 17th of July. Specifically, I'm interested in a Deluxe room. Do you have any availability for those dates?

Receptionist: Let me just check our system for the 15th to the 17th of July... Yes, I can confirm that we do have good availability for Deluxe rooms that weekend. It's quite a popular period, so I'd advise booking sooner rather than later to secure your preferred room.

Customer: Excellent news! Thank you so much for all that information. It's been very helpful. I'll discuss it with my partner tonight and hope to call back to make a reservation tomorrow.

Receptionist: You're most welcome. Please feel free to call us back anytime if you have further questions. We look forward to welcoming you to the Royal Grand Hotel.

Customer: Will do. Goodbye.

Receptionist: Goodbye.

Narrator: Section 1.
You will hear a conversation between a customer, Sarah Jenkins, and a restaurant staff member about food options and prices. First, you have some time to look at questions 1 to 5.

Narrator: You will see that there is an example that has been done for you. On this occasion only, the conversation relating to this will be played first.

Restaurant Staff: Good morning, The Willow Tree Restaurant, Mark speaking. How can I help you?
Sarah: Hello, my name is Sarah Jenkins. I'm calling to enquire about your menu and possibly make a booking for next month.

Narrator: The customer's name is Sarah Jenkins. So, 'Sarah Jenkins' has been written in the form. Now we shall begin. You should answer the questions as you listen because you will not hear the recording a second time. Listen carefully and answer questions 1 to 5.

Restaurant Staff: Good morning, The Willow Tree Restaurant, Mark speaking. How can I help you?
Sarah: Hello, my name is Sarah Jenkins. I'm calling to enquire about your menu and possibly make a booking for next month.
Restaurant Staff: Certainly, Ms. Jenkins. What kind of information are you looking for specifically?
Sarah: Well, first, I wanted to check your opening hours. Are you open every day?
Restaurant Staff: We're open from Tuesday to Sunday, from 12 noon until 10 pm. We're closed on Mondays.
Sarah: Okay, so not Mondays. Got it. And do you serve lunch and dinner throughout those hours, or are there specific times?
Restaurant Staff: We serve lunch from 12 noon until 2:30 pm, and then dinner service starts at 6 pm and runs until 9:30 pm. In between, we have a lighter menu for drinks and snacks.
Sarah: That's clear, thank you. And do I need to book in advance for lunch, or is it usually fine to just walk in?
Restaurant Staff: For lunch, it's generally fine to walk in, especially on weekdays. However, for dinner, especially on Friday and Saturday evenings, we highly recommend booking at least a week in advance to avoid disappointment.
Sarah: Right, that's helpful. One last question about general booking: do you have any private dining rooms available for larger groups?
Restaurant Staff: Yes, we do. We have one private room that can accommodate up to 15 people. It's very popular for celebrations. You would need to book that quite far in advance, usually a month or two for weekends.
Sarah: Great, thanks for that information.

Narrator: Now, listen and answer questions 6 to 10.

Sarah: So, moving on to the food itself. I'm looking for some dish recommendations. My partner and I enjoy good flavour, but I'm not a big fan of anything too... *spicy*. What would you suggest that isn't too hot, perhaps?
Restaurant Staff: I understand. For question 6, if you're looking for something that's not too spicy, our pan-fried sea bass with a lemon butter sauce is always a winner. It's very fresh and delicate. We also have a lovely roasted duck breast with cherry jus, which is rich but not spicy at all.
Sarah: The sea bass sounds perfect for me, definitely not too spicy. And for my friend, she's vegetarian. What kind of main course options do you offer for vegetarians? Specifically, for question 7, is there anything with a particular type of ingredient, like a mushroom dish, for example?
Restaurant Staff: Yes, absolutely. For question 7, our most popular vegetarian main course is the wild *mushroom* risotto. It's made with a variety of seasonal mushrooms, Arborio rice, and a touch of truffle oil. It's very rich and satisfying.
Sarah: Oh, she loves mushrooms! That sounds wonderful. Now, regarding the prices. For question 8, could you give me an idea of the average main course price? Just so I can get a general sense.
Restaurant Staff: Of course. For question 8, our main courses typically range from £16 to £22, so I'd say the average price for a main course would be around *£18*.
Sarah: Okay, £18. That's a good reference point. And are there any special offers or promotions currently running? For example, for question 9, do you have a specific day when there's a discount or a special deal?
Restaurant Staff: Yes, we do have a special offer for question 9. If you book a table for a *Tuesday* evening, we offer a complimentary dessert with any two main courses ordered. It's a nice little extra for our midweek diners.
Sarah: A complimentary dessert on Tuesdays, that's excellent! I'll certainly keep that in mind. Finally, for question 10, what are your accepted payment methods? Do you take all major credit cards, or is it cash only?
Restaurant Staff: For question 10, we accept all major credit and debit *card* payments. Of course, cash is also fine, but most of our customers prefer to pay by card these days.
Sarah: Perfect. Thank you so much, Mark. You've been very helpful. I'll discuss this with my partner and friend, and I'll call back soon to make a definite booking.
Restaurant Staff: You're very welcome, Ms. Jenkins. We look forward to hearing from you.

Narrator: That is the end of Section 1. You now have half a minute to check your answers.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 2
Narrator: You will hear a guide giving new students a tour of the university campus. First, you have some time to look at questions 11 to 20.

Narrator: Now listen carefully and answer questions 11 to 20.

Speaker: Good morning everyone, and welcome to Westlake University! My name is Alex, and I'll be your guide for today's campus tour. We're currently standing at the Main Entrance, as you can see marked on your maps. Please take a moment to orient yourselves, with the entrance behind us and the main path stretching out ahead.

Alright, let's begin! As we walk along this central pathway, I'll point out some of our key facilities and buildings. Please follow closely and feel free to ask questions at the end.

First, if you look straight ahead, down the main path, you'll see a distinctive, modern building set back slightly to the right. This is our impressive **Main Lecture Hall**, a state-of-the-art facility used for all major lectures and presentations. That’s building G on your map, for question 11.

Now, turning back towards the entrance for a moment and then looking to your immediate left as we start walking, the very first building you encounter is the multi-purpose **Student Union Building**. This is a central hub for student life, activities, and various clubs. You'll find this at location C on your map, which is the answer to question 12.

Directly opposite the Student Union, on the right side of the main path, stands our magnificent **University Library**. It houses an extensive collection of books, journals, and digital resources, along with quiet study zones. This corresponds to letter D on your map, for question 13.

Continuing a bit further down the main path, past the Library, on your left-hand side, you'll find a series of interconnected structures. The largest one here is the **Faculty of Arts** building, home to our humanities and social sciences departments. That's building E for question 14.

And just across from the Faculty of Arts, on the right-hand side, are the modern **Science Blocks**, where you'll find laboratories and research facilities for chemistry, biology, and physics. That building is marked F on your map, for question 15.

As we proceed further along the main path, you'll notice a significant turn-off to the left. If you take that short turn, you'll quickly arrive at our newly renovated **Sports Centre**. It boasts a gym, swimming pool, and courts for various indoor sports. This is location H, the answer to question 16.

Coming back to the main path and looking directly opposite the Sports Centre, on the right-hand side of the main thoroughfare, you'll see a large, bustling building. That's our main **Canteen**, offering a wide array of food and drink options throughout the day. This corresponds to letter I for question 17.

Let's backtrack slightly now, towards the entrance, but staying on the left side of the path. The building on your left, just before the Student Union, is the dedicated **IT Services** centre. It offers technical support, computer labs, and printing facilities for all students. You'll mark this as A for question 18.

And directly across the path from the IT Services centre, on the right, you'll locate the **Careers Office**. This is where you can get advice on job applications, internships, and career planning. This is at location B for question 19.

Finally, before we finish our tour, I'd like to point out the popular **Campus Café**. Many students miss it on their first visit! It's not a standalone building, but you'll find it conveniently integrated within the ground floor of the **Student Union Building** itself, offering a relaxed spot for coffee and snacks. So, for question 20, that's also location C.

That concludes our brief tour of the main campus buildings. I hope you found it helpful. Do you have any questions before we head inside?

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 3
Narrator: You will hear four university students, Mark, Lena, Omar, and Sophie, discussing their group project and assigning tasks. First, you have some time to look at questions 21 to 30.

(Pause 30 seconds)

Narrator: Now listen carefully and answer questions 21 to 30.

Mark: Alright everyone, let's get this project sorted. We've got our topic, 'The Impact of Social Media on Consumer Behaviour', and a submission deadline looming. We really need to divide the workload efficiently today.

Lena: Agreed. I've already done some preliminary reading, so I'm happy to take the lead on the **initial literature review synthesis** for question 21. I think I can consolidate the main academic viewpoints and key theories quite quickly.

Omar: That's great, Lena. You're always so thorough with research. So, Lena for the literature synthesis. What about the survey itself? Mark, I know you had some experience designing surveys for your marketing internship last summer, didn't you?

Mark: Yes, I did. I can definitely handle the **survey design** for question 22. I've got access to some good templates and I know the university's ethics guidelines pretty well, which is crucial for questionnaire construction.

Sophie: Perfect! That saves us a lot of time. Once the survey's ready, someone needs to manage the **data collection logistics** for question 23. That involves setting up the online platform, sending out invitations, and tracking responses. I'm quite organised and meticulous, so I'm happy to take that on. I'll make sure we hit our target number of participants.

Omar: Excellent, Sophie. And once we have all the data in, the next big chunk of work will be the **quantitative data analysis** for question 24. Given my background in statistics and my experience with SPSS software, I think it's logical for me to take charge of that. I'll crunch the numbers and identify the significant trends.

Lena: That's a huge relief, Omar. Statistical analysis isn't my strong suit at all! However, there'll also be a qualitative element, right? We're planning some open-ended questions. I'm quite good at identifying themes and interpreting nuances, so I could take on the **qualitative data analysis** for question 25. It would complement Omar's quantitative work nicely.

Mark: That makes a lot of sense, Lena. We'll need a good mix of both. So that's the research and analysis phase largely covered. Now, the report writing. We should probably split that up too. I can start by drafting the **introduction and methodology sections** for question 26. I've already got a good idea of how to frame the problem statement and outline our approach, connecting it to Lena's literature review.

Sophie: Sounds good, Mark. Following on from Omar's analysis, he should probably handle the **results and discussion sections** for question 27. It's best if the person who analyses the data also writes up those findings to maintain consistency and accuracy.

Omar: Yep, I'm prepared for that. It’ll be a big section, but it flows directly from my work, so it makes sense.

Lena: Great. And Sophie, you're usually very good at summarising and making recommendations. Would you be able to take on the **conclusion and recommendations** for question 28? It's often the hardest part to get just right.

Sophie: Yes, I can do that. I'll make sure to tie everything together neatly and propose some actionable recommendations based on our findings. We'll obviously need to review each other's sections to ensure continuity, but having leads is important.

Mark: Absolutely. Finally, we'll need a presentation. Lena, you're always so creative with visuals. Could you take the lead on **creating the presentation slides** for question 29? We'll all contribute content, but you could handle the overall design and compilation.

Lena: I'd be happy to. I enjoy that sort of thing. I'll make sure it's visually engaging and easy to follow. But for the **final presentation rehearsal** for question 30, I think that really needs to be a **shared responsibility**. We all need to practice delivering our parts and providing feedback to each other. We can't have just one person carrying that.

Omar: Definitely. We all need to be comfortable with the material and the timing. It's a crucial final step. Should we check in with Professor Davies about anything next week? Perhaps about our data collection strategy?

Sophie: Good idea, Omar. We could put that down as F, Project Supervisor, to consult with the lecturer on. Maybe even just a quick email to clarify the ethical approval process.

Mark: Yeah, let’s schedule a group meeting to go over everyone's initial progress next Friday. Anything that's currently **not yet determined** for G, we can finalise then, but I think we've covered the main roles for now. This is a solid plan.

Lena: I agree, Mark. Everyone knows what they're doing for the most part. This feels much more manageable now.

Narrator: That is the end of Section 3. You now have half a minute to check your answers.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part 4
Narrator: You will hear a lecturer discussing the impact of Artificial Intelligence on human communication.

Narrator: First, you have some time to look at questions 31 to 40.

Narrator: Now listen carefully and answer questions 31 to 40.

Lecturer: Good morning, everyone. Today, we delve into a topic that is rapidly reshaping our world: the transformative impact of Artificial Intelligence on human communication. From the simple chatbots of yesterday to the sophisticated generative models of today, AI's journey in this domain has been nothing short of remarkable.

Historically, early AI communication systems were predominantly built on rule-based programming. These systems could follow predetermined scripts and respond to specific keywords, offering a rudimentary form of interaction. However, what they fundamentally lacked was the capacity for true *spontaneous interaction*. Their responses were predictable, and their inability to adapt to novel conversational nuances limited their utility. (31)

Fast forward to the present, and we've witnessed a paradigm shift with the advent of advanced neural networks and deep learning. This technological leap has empowered AI to process and generate highly complex *human language* with unprecedented fluency and coherence. (32) We're no longer talking about simple pattern matching, but rather sophisticated comprehension and synthesis of meaning, context, and even subtle emotional cues.

Consider the practical applications. In global business and diplomacy, AI-powered translation tools have become indispensable. They don't just translate words; they aim to convey intent and cultural context, effectively reducing *language barriers* for international communication. (33) This fosters greater understanding and smoother collaboration across diverse linguistic landscapes. Similarly, in customer service, AI is revolutionising how businesses interact with their clients. By deploying intelligent virtual assistants, companies can offer *constant customer* service, available at any time, responding to queries, resolving issues, and even personalising recommendations, leading to enhanced user experience and operational efficiency. (34) This always-on availability significantly improves response times and accessibility.

However, this rapid advancement isn't without its challenges and ethical considerations. One significant risk of AI-generated content, whether it's news articles, social media posts, or even deepfake videos, is the potential for a decline in *public trust* about information sources. (35) Differentiating between human-authored and AI-generated content is becoming increasingly difficult, raising concerns about misinformation and the manipulation of public opinion. We are entering an era where critical thinking about information provenance is more crucial than ever.

Another critical concern revolves around bias. AI systems are trained on vast datasets of existing human communication. If these datasets reflect and contain *existing prejudices* present in society, the AI models can inadvertently reinforce and even amplify these biases in their outputs. (36) This can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, particularly in sensitive areas like hiring, lending, or even legal judgments. Mitigating bias requires careful curation of training data and robust ethical guidelines for AI development. Furthermore, the widespread integration of AI into communication workflows may necessitate new *essential digital* skills for the workforce. (37) Roles that once relied heavily on manual content creation, translation, or basic customer interaction may evolve, requiring humans to collaborate with AI rather than compete against it. This demands continuous learning and adaptation to new technological paradigms.

Let's take a real example to illustrate the magnitude of this change: Large Language Models, such as Google's LaMDA or, more famously, OpenAI's ChatGPT. These models are fundamentally changing the process of *content generation*. (38) They can write essays, compose emails, draft marketing copy, and even generate creative fiction, all at a speed and scale previously unimaginable. This capability has profound implications for industries ranging from journalism and marketing to education and entertainment. It raises questions about authorship, intellectual property, and the very nature of creativity itself. While these tools offer immense productivity gains, they also prompt us to reconsider the value of human originality and critical discernment.

Looking ahead, it is vital to establish robust *ethical governance* frameworks to guide the responsible use of AI. (39) This includes considerations for data privacy, algorithmic transparency, accountability for AI decisions, and preventing misuse. We need clear guidelines on how to develop, deploy, and interact with AI systems in a way that benefits humanity and upholds societal values. The future of human-AI communication is not merely about technological advancement; it's about fostering a symbiotic relationship. This will likely involve a focus on developing more *trustworthy systems* (40) – AI that is transparent in its operations, understandable in its reasoning, and ultimately, accountable for its actions. This will be key to ensuring that AI serves as an augmentative force, enhancing human connection and understanding, rather than replacing or undermining it. The dialogue surrounding these issues is ongoing and will shape the trajectory of AI for decades to come. Thank you.
