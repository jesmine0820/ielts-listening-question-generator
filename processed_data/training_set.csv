Woman: Six nine two four one one. Right, and you're from 'Rainbow Computers?'
Man: No. The company is Rainbow Communications [2].
Woman: Oh, OK, I'll just fix that on the system communications. And what would you like to order, John?
Man: Envelopes. We need a box of A4 - that is, normal size envelopes.
Woman: White, yellow or vanilla?
Man: We'll have the plain white please [3] - but the ones with the little windows.
Woman: OK. One box - A4 - white - just the one box, was it?
Man: Uhm, on second thoughts make that two boxes [4]. We go through heaps of envelopes. As a matter of interest. Are they made from recycled paper?
Woman: No. You can't get white recycled paper. The recycled ones are grey and they're more expensive actually.
Man: Right - we'll stick to white then.
Woman: Something else, John?
Man: Yes, we need some coloured photocopy paper. What colours do you have?
Woman: We've got purple, light blue, blue, light green - whatever you want, pretty much. There are 500 sheets to the pack.

Woman: Yes, but they're a bit more expensive than the black ones.
Man: That's alright. I'm not paying, anyway!
Woman: Right. Floppy disks. And what about diaries for next year? We've got them in stock already and it's a good idea to order early.
Man: No — I think we're alright for diaries but something we do need is one of those big wall calendars — you know, one that shows the whole year at a glance. Do you stock those?
Woman: We certainly do.
Man: OK - can you include a wall calendar then [8], with the other stuff. Just make sure it's got the whole year on the one side.

A couple of announcements for art-lovers and budding artists alike. First, a new collection of artwork is going on show to the public next month in the form of an artists' exhibition. The exhibition will include many different types of art, over 100 different pieces, by 58 artists from the local area. It's being held at the Royal Museum [11] which - for those of you who are unfamiliar with the area - is located opposite the library in West Street, right on the corner. The actual address is number 1, Queen's Park Road [12] - it isn't difficult to find. The exhibition will run for 9 weeks and will begin on the 6th of October and continue until the 10th December [13]. So there's plenty of time for you to go along and have a look and I'm sure that will be worth doing.
What will you see there? Well, amongst the items on display will be some exciting pieces of modern jewellery, furniture, ceramics, metal work [14] and sculpture. To give you some examples, local artist Kate Maine will be there to discuss her collection of pots and bowls that she has made to resemble garden vegetables. They're the sort of thing that would brighten up any dining table, and range from things like yellow cabbage-shaped bowls to round tomato-shaped teapots [15 - note that the word 'vegetable' is not mentioned, but cabbage and tomato are both vegetables]. Prize-winner Cynthia Course will also be there to talk about her silver jewellery, all of which she produced using ideas from the rural setting of her country home. Some of her rings are quite extraordinary and have beautiful coloured stones [16] in them. Or if you prefer sculpture, there's plenty of that too. Take, for example, Susan Cup's sculpture of 25 pairs of white paper shoes [17]. It sounds easy, but believe me it looks incredible! All of these items along with many others will be on sale-throughout the exhibition period.
As part of the exhibition, there will be a series of demonstrations called 'Face to Face' [18 — remember to capitalise the answer — it is a name of an exhibition] which will take place every Sunday afternoon during the exhibition and these will provide an opportunity for you to meet the artists.
The second set of activities are for those who would prefer to indulge in some artwork themselves, the Artist's Conservatory are holding a series of courses over the autumn period. The courses cover all media and include subjects such as Chinese brush painting, pencil drawing [19] and silk painting. All the tutors are experienced artists, course sizes are kept to a minimum of 15 and there will be plenty of individual assistance.
All the sessions offer excellent value for money and the opportunity to relax in a delightful rural setting. Fees are very reasonable and include the use of an excellent studio and access to the art shop which you will find sells everything from paper to CDs and they also include the provision of all materials [20]. For more information on dates, cost and availability you should get in touch with the programme coordinator on 4592 839584 or go direct to the website...",T011

We have fossils of the earliest 'true bear' — and it's important to emphasise this because some creatures are called bears but are not.
Interviewer: Such as koalas for instance.
Alison: Yes — exactly. Fossils of the true bear show a small dog-size animal with characteristics that show a blending of dog and bear traits.
Interviewer: So the general belief is that dogs and bears were of the same family? [22]
Alison: Yes, that's the theory [22]. And then we see the arrival of the early Cave Bear. We know from cave drawings that Neanderthal man used to worship this bear and at the same time fear it.
Interviewer: Understandable perhaps.
Alison: Yes, but they need not have worried because the Cave Bear only ate plants [23]. In fact the Cave Bear survived two Ice Ages but then became extinct.",T009

Alison: Well I'll answer your first question first. There are eight species of bear in all; among them the American Black Bear and the Brown Bear — from which evolved the newest species of bear - the Polar Bear.
Interviewer: So how old is the Polar Bear [24]?
Alison: Oh, he's a relative newcomer - just 20,000 years old [24].
Interviewer: And could you tell us a little about them? Which is the largest bear, for instance ?
Alison: Well, the largest bear existing today is either the Polar Bear or the Brown Bear.
Interviewer: Right! Don't we know?
Alison: Well, it depends which criteria you use. The Polar Bear is the heaviest; the male weighs up to 1,500 pounds but his narrow body actually makes him look smaller than the much more robust Brown Bear.
Interviewer: So the Brown Bear appears the biggest [25].
Alison: Yes [25].
Interviewer: And the smallest?
Alison: Well, the Sun Bear is the smallest of the eight species [26]. They only weigh between 60 and 145 pounds.
Interviewer: That makes him a comparative junior!
Alison: Yes. And then next we have the so-called Giant Panda, but that's a small bear too, comparatively speaking.
Interviewer: And are all bears meat eaters?
Alison: No, not at all. In fact the Giant Panda is almost entirely herbivorous living on a diet of 30 types of bamboo [27].
Interviewer: Oh, yes of course. Panda's are famous for that.
Alison: And another interesting bear is the Sloth Bear which eats insects [28], particularly termites. He can turn his mouth into a tube and suck the insects out of their nests.",T006

Alison: Yes indeed, they are — the Sun Bear in particular as they've been hunted almost out of existence. And the habitat of the Panda is also being reduced on a daily basis.
Interviewer: Can anything be done to reduce the threat to these endangered species? I know for instance that it's very hard to breed bears in captivity.
Alison: Yes, well, I think that by raising people's awareness generally we can reduce conflict between humans and animals, to stop the slaughter in parts of the world where bears are still hunted [29] — supposedly in self-defense or to protect livestock, but often quite unnecessarily. And we can also encourage governments to preserve the natural environment of the bear rather than allow the areas where they live to be systematically destroyed in the name of progress.
Interviewer: Yes, of course.
Alison: And in addition to these global efforts, all profits from the sale of my book will go towards the United Nations Bear Protection program [30].",T005

I'm Donald Mackie and I'm here to talk to you about the solar eclipse in history.
A thousand years ago, a total eclipse of the sun was a terrifying religious experience - but these days an eclipse is more likely to be viewed as a tourist attraction [31] than as a scientific or spiritual event. People will travel literally miles to be in the right place at the right time — to get the best view of their eclipse.
Well. What exactly causes a solar eclipse — when the world goes dark for a few minutes in the middle of the day? Scientifically speaking, the dark spot itself is easy to explain [32]: it is the shadow of the moon streaking across the earth. This happens every year or two, each time along a different and, to all intents and purposes, a seemingly random piece of the globe.
In the past people often interpreted an eclipse as a danger signal heralding disaster and in fact, the Chinese were so disturbed by these events that they included among their gods one whose job it was to prevent eclipses [33]. But whether or not you are superstitious or take a purely scientific view, our earthly eclipses are special in three ways.
Firstly, there can be no doubt that they are very beautiful. It's as if a deep blue curtain had fallen over the daytime sky as the sun becomes a black void surrounded by the glow of its outer atmosphere.
But beyond this, total eclipses possess a second more compelling beauty in the eves of us scientists, for they offer a unique opportunity for research [34]. Only during an eclipse can we study the corona and other dim things that are normally lost in the sun's glare.
And thirdly, they are rare. Even though an eclipse of the sun occurs somewhere on earth every year or two, if you sit in your garden and wait, it will take 375 years on average for one to come to you. If the moon were any larger, eclipses would become a monthly bore [35]: if it were smaller, they simply would not be possible.
The ancient Babylonian priests, who spent a fair bit of time staring at the sky, had already noted that there was an 18-year pattern in their recurrence but they didn't have the mathematics to predict an eclipse accurately [36].",T007
Q9,"['Date of \neclipse\nScientists\nObservation\n1715\nHalley\n37 __________ who accurately predicted an eclipse', 'Date of \neclipse\nScientists\nObservation\n1868\nJanssen and Lockyer\nDiscovered 38 __________', 'Date of \neclipse\nScientists\nObservation\n1878\nWatson\nBelieved he had found 39 __________', 'Date of \neclipse\nScientists\nObservation\n1919\nEinstein\nRealised astronomers had misunderstood 40 \n__________']","['first person', '(a)new element/helium', '(the) lost planet/(the) new planet/Vulcan', 'gravity']","It was Edmund Halley, the English astronomer, who knew his maths well enough to predict the return of the comet which, incidentally bears his name, and in 1715 he became the first person to make an accurate eclipse prediction [37].
This brought eclipses firmly into the scientific domain and they have since allowed a number of important scientific discoveries to be made. For instance, in the eclipse of 1868 two scientists, Janssen and Lockyer, were observing the sun's atmosphere and it was these observations that ultimately led to the discovery of a new element [38]. They named the element helium after the Greek god of the sun. This was a major find, because helium turned out to be the most common element in the universe after hydrogen. Another great triumph involved Mercury. I'll just put that up on the board for you now. See — there's Mercury — the planet closest to the Sun - then Venus, Earth, etc. For centuries, scientists had been unable to understand why Mercury appeared to rotate faster than it should. Some astronomers suggested that there might be an undiscovered planet causing this unusual orbit and even gave it the name 'Vulcan'. During the eclipse of 1878, an American astronomer, James Watson, thought he had spotted this so-called 'lost' planet [39]. But, alas for him, he was later obliged to admit that he had been wrong about Vulcan and withdrew his claim.
Then Albert Einstein came on the scene. Einstein suggested that rather than being wrong about the number of planets, astronomers were actually wrong about gravity [40]. Einstein's theory of relativity - for which he is so famous - disagreed with Newton's law of gravity in just the right way to explain Mercury's odd orbit. He also realised that a definitive test would be possible during the total eclipse of 1919 and this is indeed when his theory was finally proved correct.",T001

Jamie: OK, I'll get the brochures in the post to you but can I give you some information over the phone. What kinds of 
things do you want to do on your holiday?
Andrea: I’m interested in going to California with my family. I’ve got two children and we want to hire a car.
Jamie: OK. We have a couple of self-drive tours there visiting different places of interest in California. The first one 
begins in Los Angeles and there's plenty of time to visit some of the theme parks there [3].
Andrea: That’s something on my children’s list so I'd want to include that.
Jamie: Good. Then you drive to San Francisco. From San Francisco you can drive to Yosemite Park where you spend a 
couple of nights. You can choose to stay in a lodge or on the campsite.
Andrea: I don't like the idea of staying in a tent . It'd be too hot [4].
Jamie: Right. And the tour ends in Las Vegas.
Andrea: OK.
Jamie: The other trip we can arrange is slightly different. It starts in San Francisco. Then you drive south to Cambria.
Andrea: Someone told me there’s a really nice castle near Cambria [5]. Will we go near that?
Jamie: Hearst Castle is on that road so you could stop there.
Andrea: Good. I'd like to do that. Does this trip also go into the desert?
Jamie: No, it continues to Santa Monica where most people like to stop and do some shopping.

Q12,"['Which TWO facilities at the leisure club have recently been improved?', 'A the gym', 'B the tracks', 'C the indoor pool', 'D the outdoor pool', 'E the sports training for children']","['A', 'C']","Sandy Fisher: On behalf of LP Clubs, I’d like to welcome you all here today. My name’s Sandy Fisher and I'm one of 
the fitness managers here. Before we start our tour of the club I'll just run through some basic information about the 
facilities we have here, including recent improvements, and explain the types of membership available.
Our greatest asset is probably our swimming pool which at 25 metres isn't Olympic-sized, but now we've expanded it to 
eight lanes, it’s much wider [11/12]. This means there are rarely more than a couple of people at a time in each lane. 
Unfortunately, there isn’t space for an outdoor pool here [11/12] but the glass roof on the swimming pool is partly 
retractable, which means you can enjoy something of the open-air experience on warmer days.
Our recently refurbished fitness suite has all the latest exercise equipment including ten new running machines, and a 
wide range of weight-training machines. Each member is given full training in how to operate the equipment and there is 
always a trainer on duty to offer help and advice. Although we do have adult-only times after 6 and at certain times at 
weekends, children are well catered for. Older children continue to benefit from a wide range of tuition; anything from 
trampolining to yoga.",T005
Q13,"['Joining the leisure club', 'Personal Assessment', '• New members should describe any 13 ________ .', '• The 14 ________ will be explained to you before you use the equipment.', '• You will be given a six-week 15 ________ .', 'Types of membership', '• There is a compulsory £90 16 ________ fee for members.', '• Gold members are given 17 ________ to all the LP clubs.', '• Premier members are given priority during 18 ________ hours.', '• Premier members can bring some 19 ________ every month.', '• Members should always take their 20 ________ with them.']","['health problems', 'safety rules', 'plan', 'joining', 'free entry', 'peak', 'guests', 'photo card / photo cards']","One thing all our members appreciate about us is that we take very good care of them. This starts on day one with your 
personal assessment. You are asked to fill in a questionnaire giving details of any health problems [13]. One of our 
personal trainers will then go through this with you.
The trainer will then take you through the safety rules for using the equipment in the fitness suite [14]. During your next 
exercise session a personal trainer will work with you to make sure you understand these. It's very important to do this 
because we really do want to avoid having any sports injuries. There's a lot more to looking after yourself than simply 
lifting weights!
At the end of the personal assessment, the trainer will draw up a plan, outlining what you should try to achieve within a 
six-week period[15]. This will then be reviewed at the end of the six weeks.
Now, I’ll just quickly run through the types of membership we have available. All members must pay a joining fee of 
£90 [16] in addition to the rates for the monthly membership fees. Gold membership entitles you to free entry at all LP 
Clubs [17]. There are now LP clubs in all major cities and towns so if you travel a lot this will be a great advantage. 
Individual gold membership costs £50 a month and joint membership for you and your partner will cost £75.
Premier membership is for professional people whose work commitments make it difficult for them to use the club 
during the day and so LP gives booking preferences to Premier members at peak times [18]. This means you will find it 
easier to book the sessions at times that suit you. Reciprocal arrangements with other LP Clubs are available to Premier 
members. Premier membership is for individuals only, but you will be sent passes for quests every month [19]. The 
monthly fee is £65.
You don’t have to have any special clothes or equipment when you visit the club. We provide robes and hairdryers in the 
changing rooms, but it’s very important to remember your photo card because you won’t be able to get in without it [20].",T011

I'm working on my entry for the Global Design Competition. My tutor 
said you might be able to help me with it.
Professor: Ah, yes, I got a copy of your drawings. Come in and tell me about it. What sort of competition is it?
John: Well, it’s an international design competition and we have to come up with a new design for a typical domestic 
kitchen appliance.
Professor: I see, and are there any special conditions? Does it have to save energy for example?
John: Actually that was the focus in last year’s competition. This year’s different. We have to adopt an innovative 
approach to existing technology, using it in a way that hasn’t been thought of before [21].
Professor: I see, that sounds tricky. And what kitchen appliance have you chosen?
John: Well, I decided to choose the dishwasher.
Professor: Interesting, what made you choose that?
John: Well, they’re an everyday kitchen appliance in most Australian houses but they’re all pretty boring and almost 
identical to each other. I think some people will be prepared to pay a little extra for something that looks different [22].
Professor: That’s a nice idea. I see you’ve called your design 'the Rockpool’; why is that?
John: Basically because it looks like the rock pools you find on a beach. The top is made of glass so that you can look 
down into it.
Professor: And there’s a stone at the bottom. Is that just for decoration?
John: Actually it does have a function. Instead of pushing a button, you turn the stone [23].
Professor: So it’s really just a novel way of starting the dishwasher [23].
John: That's right.
Professor: It’s a really nice design, but what makes it innovative?
John: Well, I decided to make a dishwasher that uses carbon dioxide.
Professor: In place of water and detergent? How will you manage that?
John: The idea is to pressurise the carbon dioxide so that it becomes a liquid. The fluid is then released into the 
dishwasher where it cleans the dishes all by itself.
Professor: Sounds like a brilliant idea! Your system will totally do away with the need for strong detergents. So what 
happens once the dishes are clean?
John: Well, to allow them to dry, the liquid carbon dioxide and the waste materials all go to an area called the holding 
chamber. That's where the liquid is depressurised and so it reverts to a gas [24]. Then the oil and grease are separated out 
and sent to the waste system.
Professor: It sounds like you’ve thought it all out very thoroughly. So, what happens to the carbon dioxide once the 
process is complete? Not wasted I hope.
John: Actually, that’s where the real savings are made. The carbon dioxide is sent back to the cylinder and can be used 
again and again [25].
Professor: What a terrific idea. Do you think it will ever be built?
John: Probably not, but that’s OK.
Professor: Well, I'm sure a lot of positive things will come out of your design.",T007

university about a grant [29]? I can help you fill out the application forms if you like.
John: That would be great.
Professor: You’d better show me this paper you’ve written as well [30]. For a global competition such as this you need 
to make sure the technical details you’ve given [30] are accurate and thorough.
John: That would be a great help.
Professor: Is there anything else I can do?",T011

the black bear family. One in ten black bears is actually born with a white coat, which is the result of a special gene that 
surfaces in a few [31]. Local people have named it ‘the spirit bear'. And according to the legends of these communities, 
its snowy fur brings with it a special power [32]. Because of this, it has always been highly regarded by them - so much 
that they do not speak of seeing it to anyone else. It is their way of protecting it when strangers visit the area [33].
The white bear’s habitat is quite interesting. The bear’s strong relationship with the old- growth rainforest is a complex 
one. The white bear relies on the huge centuries-old trees in the forest in many ways. For example, the old-growth trees 
have extremely long roots that help prevent erosion of the soil along the banks of the many fish streams [34]. Keeping 
these banks intact is important because these streams are home to salmon, which are the bear’s main food source. In 
return, the bear’s feeding habits nurture the forest. As the bears eat the salmon, they discard the skin and bones in great 
amounts on the forest floor, which provide vital nutrients. These produce lush vegetation that sustains thousands of other 
types of life forms, from birds to insects and more.
Today, the spirit bear lives off the coast of the province of British Columbia on a few islands [35]. There is great concern 
for their survival since it is estimated that less than two hundred of these white bears remain. The best way to protect 
them is to make every effort to preserve the delicate balance of their forest environment - in other words, their 
ecosystem.
The greatest threat to the bear’s existence is the loss of its habitat. Over many years, logging companies have stripped the
land by cutting down a large number of trees. In addition, they have built roads which have fractured the areas where the 
bear usually feeds [36], and many hibernation sites have also been lost . The logging of the trees along the streams has 
damaged the places where the bears fish. To make matters worse, the number of salmon in those streams is declining 
because there is no legal limit on fishing [37] at the moment.
All these influences have a negative impact on the spirit bear’s very existence, which is made all the more fragile by the 
fact that reproduction among these bears has always been disappointingly low [38].
And so, what's the situation going forward? Community organisations, environmental groups and the British Columbia 
government are now working together on the problem.
The government is now requiring logging companies to adopt a better logging method [39], which is a positive step. 
However, these measures alone may not be sufficient to ensure a healthy population of the spirit bear in the future.
Other steps also need to be taken. While it is important to maintain the spirit bear’s habitat, there also needs to be more 
emphasis on its expansion [40]. The move is justified as it will also create space for other bears that are losing their 
homes...",T011

Well, I have thought about it and where I work there are no safe places to leave your bikes [8]. Interviewer: OK. Luisa: And also, I’d have to cycle uphill and on a hot day I’d arrive at work pretty sweaty so I think I’d need a shower somewhere at work [9]. Interviewer: Right.

I’m very pleased to have this opportunity to say a little about two exciting new developments in the city: the Brackenside Open-Air Swimming Pool and the children’s Adventure Playground in Central Park. As many of you may know, the idea for these initiatives came from you, the public [11], in the extensive consultation exercise which the City Council conducted last year. And they have been realised using money from the SWRDC - the South West Regional Development Commission. First of all, Brackenside Pool. As many of the older members of the audience will remember, there used to be a wonderful open-air pool on the sea front 30 years ago but it had to close when it was judged to be unsafe. For the design of this new heated pool, we were very happy to secure the talents of internationally renowned architect Ellen Wendon, who has managed to combine a charming 1930s design, which fits in so well with many of the other buildings in the area, with up-to-the-minute features such as a recycling system - the only one of its kind in the world - which enables seawater to be used in the pool [12]. Now, there has been quite a bit of discussion in the local press about whether there would be enough room for the number of visitors we’re hoping to attract [13], but the design is deceptive and there have been rigorous checks about capacity. Also, just in case you were wondering, we’re on schedule for a June 15th opening date and well within budget: a testimony to the excellent work of local contractors Hickman’s. We hope that as many people as possible will be there on June 15th. We have engaged award winning actress Coral White to declare the pool open and there’ll be drinks and snacks available at the pool side. There'll also be a competition for the public to decide on the sculpture we plan to have at the entrance: you will decide which famous historical figure from the city we should have [14].",T007

The unique design is based on the concept of the Global Village, with the playground being divided into six areas showing different parts of the world - each with a representative feature. For example, there is a section on Asia, and this is represented by rides and equipment in the shape of snakes, orangutans, tigers and so on - fauna native to the forests of the region. [15] Moving south to the Antarctic - we couldn’t run to an ice rink I’m afraid but opted instead for climbing blocks in the shape of mountains [16] - I thought they could have had slides for the glaciers but the designers did want to avoid being too literal! Then on to South America - and here the theme is El Dorado - games replicating the search for mines full of precious stones [17]. And then moving up to North America, here there was considerable debate, I know the contribution of cinema and jazz was considered but the designers finally opted for rockets and the International Space Station [18]. Eastwards to Europe then, and perhaps the most traditional choice of all the areas: medieval castles and other fortifications [19]. Then last, but not least, moving south to Africa and a whole set of wonderful mosaics to represent the great rivers [20] of this fascinating and varied continent. Now, the opening date for our Global Playground is 10th July. And again we'd love to see you there - so make a date and come and see this magnificent, original new amenity right in the heart of the city.",T006

Olivia: Sure. Why don’t you begin with describing the type of boy he was, especially his passion for collecting things [21]. Victor: That’s right, he had his own little museum. And I think it’s unusual for children to develop their own values and not join in their parents’ hobbies. I’m thinking of how Heyerdahl wouldn’t go hunting with his dad, for example. Olivia: Yeah, he preferred to learn about nature by listening to his mother read to him. And quite early on he knew he wanted to become an explorer when he grew up. That came from his camping trips he went on in Norway I think... Victor: No, it was climbing that he spent his time on as a young man [22].",T005

After university he married a classmate and together, they decided to experience living on a small island, to find out how harsh weather conditions shaped people’s lifestyles [23]. Victor: As part of their preparation before they left home, they learnt basic survival skills like building a shelter. I guess they needed that knowledge in order to live wild in a remote location with few inhabitants, cut off by the sea, which is what they were aiming to do [24].",T005

carvings that he happened to find on the island. I think you should finish with that. Victor: OK. Olivia: All right, Victor, so after your part I’ll talk about Thor Heyerdahl’s adult life, continuing from the theory he had about Polynesian migration. Up until that time of course, academics had believed that humans first migrated to the islands in Polynesia from Asia, in the west. Victor: Yes, they thought that travel from the east was impossible, because of the huge, empty stretch of ocean that lies between the islands and the nearest inhabited land[25]. Olivia: Yes, but Heyerdahl spent ages studying the cloud movements, ocean currents and wind patterns to find if it was actually possible. And another communities lying to the east of Polynesia. But Heyerdahl knew they made lots of coastal voyages in locally built canoes. Victor: Yes, or sailing on rafts, as was shown by the long voyage that Heyerdahl did next. It was an incredibly risky journey to undertake - sometimes I wonder if he did that trip for private reasons, you know? To show others that he could
have spectacular adventures. What do you think, Olivia? Olivia: Well, I think it was more a matter of simply trying out his idea, to see if migration from the east was possible. Victor: Yes, that's probably it [26]. And the poor guy suffered a bit at that time because the war forced him to stop his work for some years... Olivia: Yes. When he got started again and planned his epic voyage, do you think it was important to him that he achieve
it before anyone else did? Victor: Uhm, I haven’t read anywhere that that was his motivation. The most important factor seems to have been that he
use only ancient techniques and local materials to build his raft [27]. Olivia: Yes. I wonder how fast it went. Victor: Well, it took them 97 days from South America to the Pacific Islands. Olivia: Mm. And after that, Heyerdahl went to Easter Island, didn't he? We should mention the purpose of that trip. I 
think he sailed there in a boat made out of reeds. Victor: No, that was later on in Egypt, Olivia. Olivia: Oh, yes, that’s right. Victor: But what he wanted to do was talk to the local people about their old stone carvings and then make one himself 
to learn more about the process[28]. Olivia: I see. Well, what a great life. Even though many of his theories have been disproven, he certainly left a lasting 
impression on many disciplines, didn’t he? To my mind, he was the first person to establish what modern academics call 
practical archaeology. I mean, that they try to recreate something from the past today , like he did with his raft trip[29]. 
It’s unfortunate that his ideas about where Polynesians originated from have been completely discredited. Victor: Yes. Right, well, I'll prepare a PowerPoint slide at the end that acknowledges our sources. I mainly used The Life
and Work of Thor Heyerdahl by William Oliver. I thought the research methods he used were very sound, although I 
must say I found the overall tone somewhat old-fashioned. I think they need to do a new, revised edition[30]. Olivia: Yeah, I agree. What about the subject matter - I found it really challenging!

management. And what I'm going to present in this seminar is a few ideas about how the activity is likely to change in 
the next ten years. It isn't a scientific, statistical analysis - just some ideas for us to discuss. One area I want to mention is business markets, and I’m sure a really significant development will be a major increase in 
competition [31], with companies from all round the world trying to sell similar products. Consumers will have much more choice - for instance, food products sold in Australia might be manufactured in the 
USA, China, Finland and dozens of other countries. At the same time, mergers and takeovers mean that governments are 
actually losing power to major global corporations [32]. We can probably all think of companies that exert a great deal of influence, which may be good for consumers. A third point I want to make about markets is that in the rapidly expanding economies, such as India, China, Brazil and 
Russia, demand is growing very fast [33]. This is putting pressure on resources all over the world. I think businesses are becoming more open to external 
influences. In particular, companies are consulting customers more and more before making their business decisions 
[34]. Companies are finding out what they want and providing it, instead of making products and then trying to sell them,
which is the model of years ago. Another influence is that concerns about the environment will force manufacturers to extend product, life cycles, to 
reduce the amount of pollution and waste. And in some cases, regulation will need to be strengthened [35]. Many societies are much more fluid and democratic, and the structure of companies is changing to reflect that. I think 
we're going to see a greater emphasis within companies on teams created with a specific project in mind [36]. And when 
they're completed, the teams will be disbanded and new ones formed. More and more people see work as simply one part of their lifestyle, and not the most important one, and as the 
workforce is shrinking in some countries, businesses are having to compete for staff instead of being able to choose 
among a lot of applicants. Typical examples that will attract and retain staff are traditional ones like flexible hours and - 
something that has been made possible by advances in technology - remote working [37], with people based at their 
home, abroad, or almost anywhere they choose. Management styles will almost certainly continue to change. Senior managers will require a lot more than the efficiency 
that they’ve always needed. Above all they'll need great skills in leadership [38], so that their organisation can initiate 
and respond to change in a fast-moving world, where they face lots of competing requirements and potential conflicts. In most of the world, the senior managers of large businesses are mainly men in their fifties and sixties. The predominant
style of management will almost certainly become more consultative and collaborative, caused above all, by more 
women moving into senior management positions [39]. Many of the changes are influenced by developments in the wider economy. The traditional emphasis of business was 
manufacturing, and of course the service sector is very important. But we shouldn’t overlook the growing financial 
contribution of IP, that is, intellectual property. Some books and films generate enormous sums from the sale of related 
DVDs, music, games, clothes, and so on. Another point I’d like to make is that although I’ve been talking about companies, one trend that they have to face is the 
move away from people working for the same employer for years. Instead, more and more people are becoming self-
employed [40], to gain the freedom and control over their lives that they’re unlikely to get from being employed.",T010

Interviewer: Today we're pleased to have on the show Alice Bussell from the Dolphin Conservation Trust. Tell us about 
the Trust, Alice.
Alice: Well, obviously its purpose is to protect dolphins in seas all around the world. It tries to raise people’s awareness 
of the problems these marine creatures are suffering because of pollution and other threats. It started ten years ago and 
it’s one of the fastest growing animal charities in the country — although it's still fairly small compared with the big 
players in animal protection. We are particularly proud of the work we do in education — last year we visited a huge 
number of schools in different parts of the country, going round to talk to children and young people aged from five to 
eighteen. In fact, about thirty-five per cent of our members are children. The charity uses its money to support campaigns
— for example, for changes in fishing policy and so forth. [11/12]
It hopes soon to be able to employ its first full-time biologist — with dolphin expertise — to monitor populations. Of 
course, many people give their services on a voluntary basis and we now have volunteers working in observation, office 
work and other things. [11/12]
I should also tell you about the award we won from the Charity Commission last year — for our work in education. 
Although it’s not meant an enormous amount of money for us, it has made our activities even more widely publicised 
and understood. [13] In the long term it may not bring in extra members but we’re hoping it'll have this effect.
Interviewer: Is it possible to see dolphins in UK waters?
Alice: Yes. In several locations. And we have a big project in the east part of Scotland. This has long been a haven for 
dolphins because it has very little shipping. However, that may be about to change soon because oil companies want to 
increase exploration there. We’re campaigning against this because, although there’ll be little pollution from oil, 
exploration creates a lot of underwater noise [14]. It means the dolphins can’t rest and socialise. This is how I became 
interested in dolphin conservation in the first place.
I had never seen one and I hadn’t been particularly interested in them at school. Then I came across this story about a 
family of dolphins who had to leave their home in the Moray Firth because of the oil companies and about a child who 
campaigned to save them. I couldn't put the book down - I was hooked. [15]
Interviewer: I'm sure our listeners will want to find out what they can do to help. You mentioned the 'Adopt a Dolphin’ 
scheme. Can you tell us about that?
Alice: Of course! People can choose one of our dolphins to sponsor. They receive a picture of it and news updates. I’d 
like to tell you about four which are currently being adopted by our members: Moondancer, Echo, Kiwi and Samson. 
Unfortunately, Echo is being rather elusive this year and hasn't yet been sighted by our observers [16], but we remain 
optimistic that he’ll be out there soon. All the others have been out in force - Samson and Moondancer are often 
photographed together but it is Kiwi who's our real 'character' as she seems to love coming up close for the cameras and 
we've captured her on film hundreds of times [17].
They all have their own personalities - Moondancer is very elegant and curves out and into the water very smoothly, 
whereas Samson has a lot of energy - he’s always leaping out of the water with great vigour [18]. You’d probably expect 
him to be the youngest - he's not quite - that’s Kiwi - but Samson’s the latest of our dolphins to be chosen for the scheme 
[19].
Kiwi makes a lot of noise so we can often pick her out straightaway. Echo and Moondancer are noisy too, but

Interviewer: Today we're pleased to have on the show Alice Bussell from the Dolphin Conservation Trust. Tell us about 
the Trust, Alice.
Alice: Well, obviously its purpose is to protect dolphins in seas all around the world. It tries to raise people’s awareness 
of the problems these marine creatures are suffering because of pollution and other threats. It started ten years ago and 
it’s one of the fastest growing animal charities in the country — although it's still fairly small compared with the big 
players in animal protection. We are particularly proud of the work we do in education — last year we visited a huge 
number of schools in different parts of the country, going round to talk to children and young people aged from five to 
eighteen. In fact, about thirty-five per cent of our members are children. The charity uses its money to support campaigns
— for example, for changes in fishing policy and so forth. [11/12]
It hopes soon to be able to employ its first full-time biologist — with dolphin expertise — to monitor populations. Of 
course, many people give their services on a voluntary basis and we now have volunteers working in observation, office 
work and other things. [11/12]
I should also tell you about the award we won from the Charity Commission last year — for our work in education. 
Although it’s not meant an enormous amount of money for us, it has made our activities even more widely publicised 
and understood. [13] In the long term it may not bring in extra members but we’re hoping it'll have this effect.
Interviewer: Is it possible to see dolphins in UK waters?
Alice: Yes. In several locations. And we have a big project in the east part of Scotland. This has long been a haven for 
dolphins because it has very little shipping. However, that may be about to change soon because oil companies want to 
increase exploration there. We’re campaigning against this because, although there’ll be little pollution from oil, 
exploration creates a lot of underwater noise [14]. It means the dolphins can’t rest and socialise. This is how I became 
interested in dolphin conservation in the first place.
I had never seen one and I hadn’t been particularly interested in them at school. Then I came across this story about a 
family of dolphins who had to leave their home in the Moray Firth because of the oil companies and about a child who 
campaigned to save them. I couldn't put the book down - I was hooked. [15]
Interviewer: I'm sure our listeners will want to find out what they can do to help. You mentioned the 'Adopt a Dolphin’ 
scheme. Can you tell us about that?
Alice: Of course! People can choose one of our dolphins to sponsor. They receive a picture of it and news updates. I’d 
like to tell you about four which are currently being adopted by our members: Moondancer, Echo, Kiwi and Samson. 
Unfortunately, Echo is being rather elusive this year and hasn't yet been sighted by our observers [16], but we remain 
optimistic that he’ll be out there soon. All the others have been out in force - Samson and Moondancer are often 
photographed together but it is Kiwi who's our real 'character' as she seems to love coming up close for the cameras and 
we've captured her on film hundreds of times [17].
They all have their own personalities - Moondancer is very elegant and curves out and into the water very smoothly, 
whereas Samson has a lot of energy - he’s always leaping out of the water with great vigour [18]. You’d probably expect 
him to be the youngest - he's not quite - that’s Kiwi - but Samson’s the latest of our dolphins to be chosen for the scheme 
[19].
Kiwi makes a lot of noise so we can often pick her out straightaway. Echo and Moondancer are noisy too, but

Mia: I saw your group’s performance last night at the student theatre. It was good.
Rob: Really? Yeah... but now we have to write a report on the whole thing, an in-depth analysis. I don't know where to 
start. Like, I have to write about the role I played, the doctor, how I developed the character.
Mia: Well, what was your starting point?
Rob: Er... my grandfather was a doctor before he retired, and I just based it on him.
Mia: OK, but how? Did you talk to him about it?
Rob: He must have all sorts of stories, but he never says much about his work, even now. He has a sort of authority 
though.
Mia: So how did you manage to capture that?
Rob: I’d... I’d visualise what he must have been like in the past, when he was sitting in his consulting room listening to 
his patients. [21]
Mia: OK, so that’s what you explain in your report.
Rob: Right.
Mia: Then there’s the issue of atmosphere - so in the first scene we needed to know how boring life was in the doctor's 
village in the 1950s, so when the curtain went up on the first scene in the waiting room, there was that long silence 
before anyone spoke. And then people kept saying the same thing over and over, like 'Cold, isn't it?' [22]
Rob: Yes, and everyone wore grey and brown, and just sat in a row.
Mia: Yes, all those details of the production.
Rob: And I have to analyse how I functioned in the group — what I found out about myself. I know I was so frustrated 
at times, when we couldn’t agree.
Mia: Yes. So did one person emerge as the leader?
Rob: Sophia did. That was OK — she helped us work out exactly what to do for the production. And that made me feel 
better [23]. I suppose.
Mia: When you understood what needed doing?
Rob: Yes. And Sophia did some research, too. That was useful in developing our approach.
Mia: Like what?
Rob: Well, she found these articles from the 1950s about how relationships between children and their parents, or 
between the public and people like bank managers or the police were shifting [24].
Mia: Interesting. And did you have any practical problems to overcome?

Today, I want to talk about self-regulatory focus theory and how the actions of leaders can affect the way followers 
approach different situations. Self-regulatory focus theory is a theory developed by Tory Higgins. He says that a person’s
focus at any given time is to either approach pleasure or avoid pain. These are two basic motivations that each and every 
one of us has, and they cause us to have different kinds of goals. Promotion goals in different life situations emphasise 
achievement [31]. Prevention goals are oriented towards the avoidance of punishment.
In a specific situation, our thoughts might focus more on promotion goals or more on prevention goals. The theory 
suggests that two factors affect which goals we are focusing on. First, there is a chronic factor. This factor is connected to
a person's personality [32] and says that each person has a basic tendency to either focus more on promotion goals or 
focus more on prevention goals as part of his or her personality. Second, there is a situational factor [33] which means 
that the context we are in can make us more likely to focus on one set of goals or the other. For example, we are more 
likely to be thinking about pleasure and to have promotion goals when we are spending time with a friend [34]. In 
contrast, if we are working on an important project for our boss, we are more likely to try to avoid making mistakes and 
therefore have more prevention goals in our mind.
Research has shown that the goals we are focusing on at a given time affect the way we think. For example, when 
focusing on promotion goals, people consider their ideal self, their aspirations and gains [35]. They don't think about 
what they can lose, so they think in a happier mode. They feel more inspired to change. When people are focusing on 
prevention goals, they think about their “ought"" self. What are they supposed to be? What are people expecting from 
them? They consider their obligations to others. As a result, they experience more anxiety and try to avoid situations 
where they could lose.
Now that I have talked about the two focuses and how they affect people, I want to look at the idea that the way leaders 
behave, or their style of leading, can affect the focus [36] that followers adopt in a specific situation.
In talking about leadership, we often mention transformational leaders and transactional leaders. Transformational 
leaders, when interacting with their followers, focus on their development [37]. In their words and actions 
transformational leaders highlight change. Their speech is passionate and conveys a definitive vision [38]. All of these 
things can encourage followers to think about what could be. In other words, they inspire a promotion focus in their 
followers.
https://engexam.info/ielts-listening-practice-tests-printable/ – printable IELTS Listening tests 
Page 9
IELTS Listening – Practice Test 3
In contrast, transactional leaders focus on developing clear structures that tell their followers exactly what is expected of 
them [39]. While they do explain the rewards people will get for following orders, they emphasise more how a follower 
will be punished or that a follower won't get rewarded if his or her behaviour doesn’t change. In short, they emphasise 
the consequences of making a mistake. This emphasis will clearly lead followers to focus on avoiding punishment and 
problems. This is clearly a prevention focus.
In conclusion, it is important to understand that one focus is not necessarily better than the other one. For a designer who 
works in a field where a lot of innovation is needed, a promotion focus is probably better [40]. In contrast, a prevention 
focus which causes people to work more cautiously and produce higher quality work might be very appropriate for a job 
like a surgeon, for example. The main point of the research, though, is that the actions of leaders can greatly influence 
whether people approach a situation with more of a promotion focus or more of a prevention focus.

A small port was already established here when, about 900 years ago, tin was discovered nearby, though it wasn’t until the Industrial Revolution, when a tremendous need for metals of all kinds developed, that Manham expanded to become one of the busiest ports in the country [12].
And because it was already so busy, prospectors began to look for other minerals, and by the end of the nineteenth century, lead, copper, manganese and arsenic were added to the cargos leaving Manham.
In the early days, the ores had been smelted - or processed - in the same area they were mined. But, as demand grew, the smelting process required huge factory furnaces or fires to melt the metal from the rock and there was not enough coal in the local area, so the rocks containing minerals had to be shipped long distances [13].
Sadly, in the twentieth century, the great port of Manham declined, and thousands of workers were forced to emigrate out of the area [14]. The building at the port fell into disrepair, and the place became almost forgotten. But then, the Manham Trust was formed to conserve the historical resources of the area. It organised scores of local volunteers to remove undergrowth to find the original outlines of the installations. It then brought in paid professionals to match installations with maps of the original port complex and to set about reconstructing it [15].",T007

You should start by getting their booklet [25] with all the details - I expect you can download one from their website.
Tim: Actually, they’ve got copies in the psychology department [25] - I’ve seen them there. I'll just go to the office and pick one up.
Laura: Right. And then if I were you, after I’d looked at it I'd go over all the options with someone...

Laura:And then when you know what you want you can register with STEP - you’ll find their address in the booklet. And once you’ve registered they assign you to a mentor who looks after your application.
Tim:And then I suppose you just sit back and wait till you hear something? They told me at the careers office that it’s best to be proactive, and get updates yourself by checking the website for new placement alerts [27].
Laura: Your mentor is supposed to keep you informed, but you can't rely on that.
Tim:I don’t suppose it’s a good idea to get in touch with companies directly, is it?
Laura: Not really... But it is the company who notifies you if they want you to go for an interview. You get a letter of invitation or an email from personnel departments [28].
Tim:And do I reply directly to them?
Laura: Yes, you do STEP only gets involved again once you've been made a job offer.
Tim: Right... So, once you’ve had an interview you should let your mentor know what the outcome is? I mean whether you’re offered a job, and whether you’ve decided to accept it?
Laura: That’s right [29]. They'll inform the careers office once a placement has been agreed, so you don’t have to do that.
Tim:Is that all then?
Laura: More or less. Only once you’ve accepted an offer you’ll probably have to supply a reference [30], because the placement will be conditional on that.
Tim:And that’s something you should ask your own tutor to provide [30].",T006

However, all new technologies have their teething problems. And with nanotechnology, society often gets the wrong idea about its capabilities [31].
Numerous science-fiction books and movies have raised people's fears about nanotechnology - with scenarios such as inserting little nano-robots into your body that monitor everything you do without you realising it, or self-replicating nano-robots that eventually take over the world.
So how do we safeguard such a potentially powerful technology? Some scientists recommend that nano-particles be treated as new chemicals with separate safety tests and clear labelling [32].
They believe that greater care should also be taken with nano-particles in laboratories and factories [32]. Others have called for a withdrawal of new nano products such as cosmetics and a temporary halt to many kinds of nano-tech research. But as far as I’m concerned there's a need to plough ahead with the discoveries and applications of nanotechnology [33].",T007

These could be virtually unbreakable, lighter and much more pliable leading to planes that are 50 times lighter than at present. Those same improved capabilities will dramatically reduce the cost of travelling into space making it more accessible to ordinary people [35] and opening up a totally new holiday destination.
In terms of technology, the computer industry will be able to shrink computer parts down to minute sizes. We need nanotechnology in order to create a new generation of computers that will work even faster and will have a million times more memory [36] but will be about the size of a sugar cube.
Nanotechnology could also revolutionise the way that we generate power. The cost of solar cells will be drastically reduced so harnessing this energy will be far more economical [37] than at present.
But nanotechnology has much wider applications than this and could have an enormous impact on our environment. For instance, tiny airborne nano-robots could be programmed to actually rebuild the ozone layer, which could lessen the impact of global warming on our planet. That’s a pretty amazing thought, isn’t it? On a more local scale, this new technology could help with the clean-up of environmental disasters as nanotechnology will allow us to remove oil and other contaminants from the water far more effectively [38]. And, if nanotechnology progresses as expected - as a sort of building block set of about 90 atoms - then you could build anything you wanted from the bottom up. In terms of production, this means that you only use what you need and so there wouldn't be any waste [39].
The notion that you could create anything at all has major implications for our health. It means that we’ll eventually be able to replicate anything. This would have a phenomenal effect on our society. In time it could even lead to the eradication of famine through the introduction of machines that produce food to feed the hungry.
But it’s in the area of medicine that nanotechnology may have its biggest impact. How we detect disease will change as tiny biosensors are developed to analyse tests in minutes rather than days [40]. There’s even speculation nano-robots could be used to slow the ageing process, lengthening life expectancy.",T011

How many were there? Well, only 473 Duesenberg J-types were ever built [11] and the model here is one of the rarest.
Each had a short 125-inch chassis or framework and the body was always in the form of an open two-seater [12] .
The technology behind the car's 6.9-litre engine was extraordinary. It featured capsules of mercury in the engines to absorb vibration and provide an incredibly smooth ride [13].
In fact, these cars offered unparalleled performance, in an age when 160 kilometres per hour was considered very fast, the Duesenberg promised a top speed of 180 kilometres per hour [14] and could do 140 kilometres per hour in second gear.
Duesenberg, who designed the car, sold it as a frame and engine [15] ... this was typical of the age again and many prestige manufacturers such as Rolls-Royce did exactly the same. Owners able to afford the hefty $9,000 price tag for the basic car would then commission a coachwork company to build a body tailored to their own individual requirements.
The Duesenberg's great attraction for the driver was its instrument panel which offered all the usual features but also several others including a stop-watch [16].
It was the Duesenberg's technology that lay behind its success as a racing car and they dominated the American racing scene in the 1920s winning the Indianapolis Grand Prix in 1924, '25 and '27.
On to another celebrity, the 1922 Leyat Helica. Only 30 of these French propeller cars were built [17] and the model here at Goodwood, which was the fourth to be made, is thought to be the only surviving example still capable of running.
The brains behind this car was Marcel Leyat who was an aviation pioneer first and foremost, and the influence of flying is quite apparent in the car. The Leyat very strongly resembles a light aircraft [18] with its front propeller but in this case it's minus any wings [19] of course!
It's quite odd to think that this car was whirring through France, just as the Duesenberg was blasting down roads at 160 kilometres per hour across the Atlantic. The Leyats were used regularly in France in the 1920s and were even produced in saloon and van form, as well as two-seater. The Leyat matched its propeller drive with its equally bizarre steering which used the rear rather than the front wheels [20]! But despite looking rather frail, it was a tough machine. In fact, when troops tried to steal it during the Second World War, the car's baffling design was clearly beyond the would-be thieves and it ended up being driven into a tree, breaking the propeller.",T011

Rosie: As you probably know, the Complex and the Park show all the latest films, while the late-night cinema tends to show cult films. So, when we interviewed the students, we thought the Complex would be the most popular choice of cinema ... but surprisingly it was the late-night Odeon [24] .
Mike: Yeah, and most students said that if they wanted to see a new film, they waited for it to show at the Park because the complex is more expensive and further out of town so you have to pay more to get there as well.
Tutor: Yes, and that adds to the cost, of course, and detracts from the popularity [24], evidently .
Rosie: Well, next, we looked at theatres. The results here were interesting because, as you know, there's a theatre on campus, which is popular. But there's also the Stage Theatre in town, which is very old and architecturally quite beautiful. And there's the large, modern theatre, the Ashtop, that has recently been built.
Tutor: So you just looked at the two theatres in town?
Mike: Yes. But the thing about the theatres is that there's a whole variety of seat prices. Also, the types of performance vary ... so students tend to buy seats at both and like using both for different reasons [25] and if they want cheap seats at the Ashtop, they can just sit further from the front.
Rosie: What we did find that was very interesting is that there are periods during the year when students seem to go to the theatre and periods when they go to the cinema and we really think that's to do with budget. If you look at this graph, you can see that there's a peak around November/December when they go to the theatre more and then a period in April/May when neither is particularly popular [26] and then theatre viewing seems to trail off virtually while the cinema becomes quite popular in June/July [26] .",T007

As you know, dust storms have always been a feature of desert climates, but what we want to focus on today is the extent to which human activity is causing them [31]. And it is this trend that I want to look at, because it has wide-ranging implications.
So - what are these human activities ? Well, there are two main types that affect the wind erosion process, and thus the frequency of dust storms. There are activities that break up naturally wind-resistant surfaces such as off-road vehicle use and construction and there are those that remove protective vegetation cover from soils, for example, mainly farming and drainage.

Perhaps the best-known example of agricultural impact on desert dust is the creation of the USA's 'dust bowl' in the 1930s. The dramatic rise in the number of dust storms during the latter part of that decade was the result of farmers mismanaging their land. In fact, choking dust storms became so commonplace that the decade became known as the 'Dirty Thirties'. [33]
Researchers observed a similar, but more prolonged, increase in dustiness in West Africa between the 1960s and the 1980s when the frequency of the storms rose to 80 a year and the dust was so thick that visibility was reduced to 1,0 metres. This was a hazard to pilots and road users.
In places like Arizona, the most dangerous dust clouds are those generated by dry thunderstorms. [34] Here, this type of storm is so common that the problem inspired officials to develop an alert system to warn people of oncoming thunderstorms. When this dust is deposited it causes all sorts of problems for machine operators. [35] It can penetrate the smallest nooks and crannies and play havoc with the way things operate because most of the dust is made up of quartz which is very hard.
Another example - the concentration of dust originating from the Sahara has risen steadily since the mid-1960s.
This increase in wind erosion has coincided with a prolonged drought, [36] which has gripped the Sahara's southern fringe. Drought is commonly associated with an increase in dust-raising activity but it's actually caused by low rainfall which results in vegetation dying off.",T011
Q51,[],"['irrigation', 'two-thirds', 'salty/saline/toxic', 'crops/plants/agriculture']","Lecturer: One of the foremost examples of modern human-induced environmental degradation is the drying up of the Aral Sea in Central Asia. Its ecological demise dates from the 1950s when intensive irrigation began in the then Central Asian [37] republics of the USSR. This produced a dramatic decline in the volume of water entering the sea from its two major tributaries. In 1960, the Aral Sea was the fourth-largest lake in the world, but since that time it has lost two-thirds of its volume [38], its surface area has halved and its water level has dropped by more than 216 metres. A knock-on effect of this ecological disaster has been the release of significant new sources of wind-blown material, as the water level has dropped.
And the problems don't stop there. The salinity of the lake has increased [39] so that it is now virtually the same as sea water. This means that the material that is blown from the dry bed of the Aral Sea is highly saline. Scientists believe it is adversely affecting crops [40] around the sea because salts are toxic to plants.",T011

You do have over a hundred to choose from, they're mostly sandy beaches and they vary from the largest which is two and a half kilometres long, to tiny sandy coves. But there are a few that I'd really recommend you to visit. So looking at this pamphlet, first of all there's Bandela beach. This beach is one kilometre away from the old fishing village of Bandela [11], which is a beautiful spot. If you park in the car park behind it, there's a small path which leads down to the bay. It's very pretty because the whole beach is backed by pine trees [12] so its very sheltered. The beach itself is very clean and the water is shallow and safe. That together with the soft sand make it an ideal beach for children and non-swimmers. A little further round the coast, again to the east, in the eastern corner of the island, is the spectacular Da Porlata beach which is basically a long inlet. The land around this beach is marshland, it's all marsh [13], and there's a stream which winds through it and the stream goes into the sea, and the beach has lovely pale gold sand. Access to this beach is quite tricky and not for the less energetic! You have to go down a long flight of steps - 190 to be exact. But you'll be relieved to know that there's also a road which winds down to a car parking area. When you're level with the sea, there is a handful of shops and bars and you can hire sunbeds and umbrellas [14] . Continuing round the island, just past the Tip of Cain is the next beach I'd suggest you visit and this is San Gett. Why? Because there isn't a beach longer than this on the island [15]. If you want to know, it's exactly two and a half kilometres long and that's a bonus because it means it never gets overcrowded. It has golden sand and clear, blue water shelving into the sea. There are several beach restaurants to choose from and watersports are available when the water is calm. But check first. This beach operates a flag system [16] as the sea can get rough and you should always swim between the flags. There's a large car park which gives you easy access to the eastern end of the beach but the western end is much quieter and more wild as it is harder to reach. Blanaka is another popular beach — just in the north-west corner of the island [17]. It has incredibly white sand and sparkling water. There is ample car parking here and plenty of bars and restaurants. Blanaka has white cliffs all around it [18] and for those of you who'd like a little more to do than just lazing on the beach, there are caves here which you can explore in the cliffs and you can also dive into the water from rock platforms along the side of the cove. Well, my final recommendation for today is Dissidor. Now this beach isn't quite as easy to get to as the others I've talked about. It's quite a remote little beach tucked away here next to Blanaka. You can reach Dissidor by a steep slope which goes over some sandbanks [19] . The beach itself is small and pretty, with reddish-coloured sand and some stony areas on its eastern side. Despite being quite small the bathing is good and you can also go fishing here from the rocks at either side. It's a good idea to take some food and drink with you [20] if you decide to go here as there's only one little bar which isn't always open.",T001

Lee Rogers talks to one major book store manager. Lee: Jenny Farrow, you're the manager of Dalton Books - and you sell an awful lot of books to students, don't you? Jenny: Yes! We do. Lee: How do you manage to make sure that you're going to have the books students need when all the new courses begin? Jenny: Basically, we make preparations long before they arrive. Like all other major book retailers, we have a database of information, and using that, we contact course conveners in May and ask them to send us their booklists [21]. Lee: How many books are we talking about? Jenny: For one course? Lee: Yes, as an example. Jenny: An average course requires about 30 books. We ask lecturers to indicate whether a book is what we call 'essential' reading... you know, the students simply have to get it, or whether it's what they would term 'recommended' reading [22]or whether it's just a supplementary text that they tend to refer to as 'background' reading. Lee: What about predicted buyers? Jenny: It's not a perfect system unfortunately. If a lecturer tells us that he expects us to sell 100 copies of a book, we know that we could actually sell anything from 50 to 150. That's why in practice, when it comes to ordering, it's a lot safer to go by the previous year's sales figures [23] - if that's possible of course... if we've sold the book before. We also build other factors into the equation including the type of course that the books are for, the students' year group [24] and a measure of our own judgement. Lee: And these criteria make a fairly accurate guide? Jenny: As accurate as we can be, yes. Lee: What about the publishers? Do they take an active role in promoting new books? Jenny: Certainly. The academic and professional publishing market is worth about ?700 million a year, so publishers go to some lengths to make sure their books are known. The standard procedure they use is to mail out catalogues to lecturers or colleges and universities [25], that's been the main form of promotion for years. Now, of course, they can also post details of new or revised works on websites. Some even go so far as writing individual letters to the appropriate lecturers [26] in order to let them know what's coming up. Lee: The lecturers then contact you if they're interested ... Jenny: That's right. The publishers send us - the book sellers - 'inspection copies' [27]. Lecturers can then get a free copy and decide whether it's going to be suitable for their course. Lee: And how does it work with the students? What are they looking for and who helps them most? Jenny: I think lecturers are best placed to understand the students' needs. Often the critical issue is what represents value for money for students [28]. This is more important than price per se. Lee: Do students actually buy books before they start the course? Jenny: Apparently a large proportion of students wait to see what they need. Students have a firm idea of what constitutes a good book so they tend to give themselves time to look at all the options before making a choice. They tend to go for books that are clear and easy to use [29,30] . Often the texts that their lecturers recommend turn out to be too academic and remain here on our shelves.",T011

Over to you Rebecca. Rebecca: Thank you for inviting me. I remember when I graduated back in 1983, I was very excited about getting my first commission. My degree was in Fine Art and I'd worked long and hard to get it. I was an enthusiastic student and I never found it difficult to find the incentive to paint [31 - not the answer, but a contrast to what follows]. I think as a student you're pushed along by fellow students and tutors and the driving force is there. However, when you leave college you find yourself saying things like 'I'll have one more cup of coffee and then I'll sit down to work'. I hate to admit it but I say it myself. Suddenly it isn't finding the inspiration or getting the right paper that's a problem, it's you [31].",T007

It's a real challenge making a decent living as a new artist [32], you have to find a market for your work, often you work freelance and need to take samples or portfolios of your work from place to place... these experiences are common to a lot of professional people, but artists also have to bare their souls to the world in a way, more than anything they want praise, if people don't like what they create then it can be a very emotional and upsetting experience hearing them say this [33].",T005

I was a painter but I started to dabble in illustration, drawing pictures for books, cards, and this offered me the opportunity to become more emotionally detached from my work [34 - she wasn't subjective (emotional) anymore, therefore she became more objective]. I was no longer producing images from the heart but developing images for a specified subject, taking a more practical approach . I began to develop a collection of my illustrations which I put into a portfolio and started to carry around with me to show prospective clients and employers. But it was still tricky because publishers, for example, want to know that your drawings will reproduce well in a book, but without having had any work published, it's hard to prove this [35]. Having a wonderful portfolio or collection of original artwork is, of course, a first step but what most potential clients would like to see is printed artwork and without this 'evidence' they tend to hold back still when it comes to offering a contract .",T007

And I suppose this is my advice to you on preparing your portfolio of your best work. The first way was by submitting my work for a competition [36], and the one I chose was for a horoscope design and was sponsored by a top women's magazine. There are a few of these competitions each year and they offer new illustrators an opportunity to showcase their work. The other approach I took was to design and print some mock-up pages of a book [37]. In other words, I placed some of my illustrations next to some text in order to demonstrate how my work would look when it was printed. Perhaps I was lucky in that I had taken a degree that provided me with all-round creative skills so that I could vary my style and wasn't limited to a certain technique [38]. I think that is important. The art world, and many other creative fields, do try to pigeon-hole people into snug boxes with an accompanying label. I think you should try to resist this if you feel it happening to you. If you don't, you'll find it difficult to have new work accepted if you try to develop your style at a later stage in your career. Nevertheless, when you start out and particularly when you're going for an interview, it's important not to confuse people by having a lot of different examples in your portfolio. One remedy for this is to separate your work into distinct categories [39]. In my case, I did this by dividing my design-inspired illustrations from my paintings. It is then easier to analyse the market suited to each portfolio; such as magazines, book jackets, CD covers etc. Working under two names is also useful [40] as it clarifies the different approaches and offers a distinction between them.",T011

Well yes, dogs with jobs is the subject of today's programme. Dogs have earned themselves a reputation over the centuries for being extremely loyal [11]. And here's a little story which illustrates just how loyal they are. Just outside the country town of Gundagai, is a statue built to commemorate a dog [12] - a dog which sat waiting for his owner to return to the spot where he'd left him.

Perhaps the most well known of working dogs is the border collie sheep dog. Sheep dogs which work in unison with their masters need to be smart and obedient with a natural ability to herd sheep. Some farmers say that their dogs are so smart that they not only herd sheep, they can count them [13], too! Another much-loved working dog is the guide dog, trained to work with the blind. Guide dogs, usually Labradors, need to be confident enough to lead their owner through traffic and crowds but they must also be of a gentle nature [14]. It costs a great deal of money to train a dog for this very valuable work but the Guide Dog Associations in the UK, America and Australia receive no government assistance so all the money comes from donations [15]. Another common breed of work dog is the German shepherd. German shepherds make excellent guard dogs and are also very appropriate as search and rescue [16] dogs working in disaster zones after earthquakes and avalanches. These dogs must be tough and courageous to cope with the arduous conditions of their work. And so that they can be sent anywhere in the world to assist in disaster relief operations, effective dogs and their trainers are now listed on an international database [17]. When you arrive at an airport here in Australia, you may be greeted in the baggage hall by a detector dog, wearing a little red coat bearing the words 'Quarantine'. These dogs are trained to sniff out fresh fruit as well as meat and even live animals hidden in people's bags. In order to be effective, a good detector dog must have an enormous food drive - in other words they must really love their food [18]. At Sydney airport where there are ten detector dogs working full time, they stop about 80 people a month [19] trying to bring illegal goods into the country. And according to their trainers, they very rarely get it wrong! Another famous working dog is the husky. Huskies, which originally came from Siberia, have been used for decades as a means of transport on snow, particularly in Antarctica where they have played an important role. Huskies are well adapted to harsh conditions and they enjoy working in a team [20]. But the huskies have all left Antarctica now because the International Treaty prohibits their use in the territory as they are not native animals. Many people were sad to see the dogs leave Antarctica as they had been vital to the early expeditions and earned their place in history along with the explorers.",T001

Linda is going to talk to us about the system of writing for the blind known as Braille. Linda, welcome. Dr. Graycar: Thank you. Chairman: Now we'd like to keep this session pretty informal, and I know Linda won't mind if members of the group want to ask questions as we go along. Let's start with an obvious one. What is Braille and where does it get its name from? Dr. Graycar: Well, as you said, Braille is a system of writing used by and for people who cannot see. It gets its name from the man who invented it, the Frenchman Louis Braille who lived in the early 19th century. Chairman: Was Louis Braille actually blind himself? Dr. Graycar: Well... he wasn't born blind, but he lost his sight at the age of three as the result of an accident in his father's workshop [21]. Louis Braille then went to Paris to the National Institute for Blind Children and that's where he invented his writing system at the age of only 15 in 1824 [22] while he was at the Institute. Chairman: But he wasn't the first person to invent a system of touch reading for the blind, was he? Dr. Graycar: No - another Frenchman had already come up with the idea of printing embossed letters that stood out from the paper but this was very cumbersome and inefficient. Chairman: Did Louis Braille base his system on this first one? Dr. Graycar: No, not really. When he first went to Paris he heard about a military system of writing using twelve dots. This was a system invented by an enterprising French army officer and it was known as 'night writing' [23] It wasn't meant for the blind, but rather for battle communications at night.",T009

Dr. Graycar: Anyway, Braille took this system as a starting point but instead of using the twelve dots which 'night writing' used, he cut the number of dots in half and developed a six-dot system. Chairman: Can you give us a little more information about how it works? Dr. Graycar: Well, it's a system of touch reading which uses an arrangement of raised dots called a cell. Braille numbered the dot positions 1-2-3 downward on the left and 4-5-6 downward on the right [24] . The letters of the alphabet are then formed by using different combinations of these dots. Student: So is the writing system based on the alphabet with each word being individually spelt out? Dr. Graycar: Well ... it's not quite that simple, I'm afraid! For instance, the first 10 letters of the alphabet are formed using dots 1, 2, 4 and 5. But Braille also has its own short forms for common words [25]. For example, 'b' for the word 'but' and 'h' for 'have' - there are many other contractions like this. Chairman: So you spell out most words letter by letter, but you use short forms for common words [25]. Dr. Graycar: Yes. Though, I think that makes it sound a little easier than it actually is! Chairman: And was it immediately accepted? I mean, did it catch on straight away? Dr. Graycar: Well, yes and no! It was immediately accepted and used by Braille's fellow students at the school but the system was not officially adopted until 1854, two years after Braille's death [26]. So, official acceptance was slow in coming! Student: I suppose it works for all languages which use the roman alphabet? Dr. Graycar: Yes, it does, with adaptations, of course. Student: Can it be written by hand or do you need a machine to produce Braille? Dr. Graycar: Well, you can write it by hand on to paper with a device called a slate and stylus but the trick is that you have to write backwards [27], for example from right to left so that then when you turn your sheet over, the dots face upwards and can be read like English from left to right.",T007

Dr. Graycar: Yes, indeed. In addition to the literary Braille code, as it's known, which of course includes English and French, there are other codes. For instance, in 1965 they created a form of Braille for Mathematics [28]. Student: I can’t, imagine trying to do maths in Braille! Dr. Graycar: Yes, that does sound difficult, I agree.

Our memories, it's true to say, work very differently depending upon whether we are very old, very young or somewhere in the middle. But when exactly do we start to remember things and how much can we recall? One of the first questions that we might ask is - do babies have any kind of episodic memory, can they remember particular events [31]? Obviously, we can't ask them, so how do we find out? Well, one experiment that's been used has produced some interesting results. It's quite simple and involves a baby, in its cot, a colourful mobile and a piece of string [32]. It works like this. If you suspend the mobile above the cot and connect the baby's foot to it with the string the mobile will move every time the baby kicks. Now you can allow time for the baby to learn what happens and enjoy the activity. Then you remove the mobile for a time and re-introduce it some time from one to fourteen days later [33]. If you look at this table of results, at the top two rows you can see that what is observed shows that two-month-old babies can remember the trick for up to two days and three-month-old babies for up to a fortnight [34]. And although babies trained on one mobile will respond only if you use the familiar mobile, if you train them on a variety of colours and designs, they will happily respond to each one in turn. Now, looking at the third row on the table, you will see that when they learn to speak, babies as young as 21 months demonstrate an ability to remember events which happened several weeks earlier. And by the time they are two, some children's memories will stretch back over six months [35], though their recall will be random, with little distinction between key events and trivial ones and very few of these memories, if any, will survive into later life. So we can conclude from this that even very tiny babies are capable of grasping and remembering a concept.",T011

Well, one theory accounting for all of this - and this relates to the next question we might ask - is that memory develops with language [36] . Very young children with limited vocabularies are not good at organising their thoughts. Though they may be capable of storing memories, do they have the ability to retrieve them [37]? One expert has suggested an analogy with books on a library shelf. With infants, he says, 'it is as if early books are hard to find because they were acquired before the cataloguing system was developed'. But even older children forget far more quickly than adults do. In another experiment, several six-year-olds, nine-year-olds and adults were shown a staged incident. In other words, they all watched what they thought was a natural sequence of events. The incident went like this: a lecture which they were listening to was suddenly interrupted by something accidentally overturning, in this case it was a slide projector. To add a third stage and make the recall more demanding, this 'accident' was then followed by an argument [38]. In a memory test the following day, the adults and the nine-year-olds scored an average 70% [39] and the six- year-olds did only slightly worse. In a retest five months later, the pattern was very different. The adults' memory recall hadn't changed but the nine-year-olds' had slipped to less than 60% and the six-year-olds could manage little better than 40% recall [40].",T009
