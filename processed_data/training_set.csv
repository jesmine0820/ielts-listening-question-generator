Announcer: And now for some information on local events and activities. A couple of announcements for art-lovers and 
budding artists alike. First, a new collection of artwork is going on show to the public next month in the form of an 
artists' exhibition. The exhibition will include many different types of art, over 100 different pieces, by 58 artists from the
local area. It's being held at the Royal Museum [11] which - for those of you who are unfamiliar with the area - is located
opposite the library in West Street, right on the corner. The actual address is number 1, Queen's Park Road [12] - it isn't 
difficult to find. The exhibition will run for 9 weeks and will begin on the 6th of October and continue until the 10th 
December [13]. So there's plenty of time for you to go along and have a look and I'm sure that will be worth doing.
What will you see there? Well, amongst the items on display will be some exciting pieces of modern jewellery, furniture, 
ceramics, metal work [14] and sculpture. To give you some examples, local artist Kate Maine will be there to discuss her 
collection of pots and bowls that she has made to resemble garden vegetables. They're the sort of thing that would 
brighten up any dining table, and range from things like yellow cabbage-shaped bowls to round tomato-
 
 shaped teapots
 
  
[15 - note that the word 'vegetable' is not mentioned, but cabbage and tomato are both vegetables]. Prize-winner 
Cynthia Course will also be there to talk about her silver jewellery, all of which she produced using ideas from the rural 
setting of her country home. Some of her rings are quite extraordinary and have beautiful coloured stones [16] in them. 
Or if you prefer sculpture, there's plenty of that too. Take, for example, Susan Cup's sculpture of 25 pairs of white paper 
shoes [17]. It sounds easy, but believe me it looks incredible! All of these items along with many others will be on sale-
throughout the exhibition period.
As part of the exhibition, there will be a series of demonstrations called 'Face to Face' [18 — remember to capitalise 
the answer — it is a name of an exhibition] which will take place every Sunday afternoon during the exhibition and 
these will provide an opportunity for you to meet the artists.
The second set of activities are for those who would prefer to indulge in some artwork themselves, the Artist's 
Conservatory are holding a series of courses over the autumn period. The courses cover all media and include subjects 
such as Chinese brush painting, pencil drawing [19] and silk painting. All the tutors are experienced artists, course sizes 
are kept to a minimum of 15 and there will be plenty of individual assistance.
All the sessions offer excellent value for money and the opportunity to relax in a delightful rural setting. Fees are very 
reasonable and include the use of an excellent studio and access to the art shop which you will find sells everything from 
paper to CDs and they also include the provision of all materials [20]. For more information on dates, cost and 
availability you should get in touch with the programme coordinator on 4592 839584 or go direct to the website...",T011

Interviewer: Alison Sharp has spent much of her life researching bears and in particular bears in danger of extinction. 
She is the author of a recent book on bears and we welcome her to the studio today.
Alison: Thank you. Delighted to be here.
Interviewer: First of all, can you give us a quick overview of the history of the bear family?
Alison: Well, the bears we know today actually have as their ancestors bears which have been evolving for some 40 
million years [21]. We have fossils of the earliest 'true bear' — and it's important to emphasise this because some 
creatures are called bears but are not.
Interviewer: Such as koalas for instance.
Alison: Yes — exactly. Fossils of the true bear show a small dog-size animal with characteristics that show a blending of 
dog and bear traits.
Interviewer: So the general belief is that dogs and bears were of the same family? [22]
Alison: Yes, that's the theory [22]. And then we see the arrival of the early Cave Bear. We know from cave drawings that 
Neanderthal man used to worship this bear and at the same time fear it.
Interviewer: Understandable perhaps.
Alison: Yes, but they need not have worried because the Cave Bear only ate plants [23]. In fact the Cave Bear survived 
two Ice Ages but then became extinct.",T009

Alison: Well I'll answer your first question first. There are eight species of bear in all; among them the American Black 
Bear and the Brown Bear — from which evolved the newest species of bear - the Polar Bear.
Interviewer: So how old is the Polar Bear [24]?
Alison: Oh, he's a relative newcomer - just 20,000 years old [24].
Interviewer: And could you tell us a little about them? Which is the largest bear, for instance ?
Alison: Well, the largest bear existing today is either the Polar Bear or the Brown Bear.
Interviewer: Right! Don't we know?
Alison: Well, it depends which criteria you use. The Polar Bear is the heaviest; the male weighs up to 1,500 pounds but 
his narrow body actually makes him look smaller than the much more robust Brown Bear.
Interviewer: So the Brown Bear appears the biggest [25].
Alison: Yes [25].
Interviewer: And the smallest?
Alison: Well, the Sun Bear is the smallest of the eight species [26]. They only weigh between 60 and 145 pounds.
Interviewer: That makes him a comparative junior!
Alison: Yes. And then next we have the so-called Giant Panda, but that's a small bear too, comparatively speaking.
Interviewer: And are all bears meat eaters?
Alison: No, not at all. In fact the Giant Panda is almost entirely herbivorous living on a diet of 30 types of bamboo [27].
Interviewer: Oh, yes of course. Panda's are famous for that.
Alison: And another interesting bear is the Sloth Bear which eats insects [28], particularly termites. He can turn his 
mouth into a tube and suck the insects out of their nests.",T007

Alison: Yes indeed, they are — the Sun Bear in particular as they've been hunted almost out of existence. And the habitat
of the Panda is also being reduced on a daily basis.
Interviewer: Can anything be done to reduce the threat to these endangered species? I know for instance that it's very 
hard to breed bears in captivity.
Alison: Yes, well, I think that by raising people's awareness generally we can reduce conflict between humans and 
animals, to stop the slaughter in parts of the world where bears are still hunted [29] — supposedly in self-defense or to 
protect livestock, but often quite unnecessarily. And we can also encourage governments to preserve the natural 
environment of the bear rather than allow the areas where they live to be systematically destroyed in the name of 
progress.
Interviewer: Yes, of course.
Alison: And in addition to these global efforts, all profits from the sale of my book will go towards the United Nations 
Bear Protection program [30].",T005

Man: Good evening and welcome to this month's Observatory Club lecture. I'm Donald Mackie and I'm here to talk to 
you about the solar eclipse in history.
A thousand years ago, a total eclipse of the sun was a terrifying religious experience - but these days an eclipse is more 
likely to be viewed as a tourist attraction [31] than as a scientific or spiritual event. People will travel literally miles to be
in the right place at the right time — to get the best view of their eclipse.
Well. What exactly causes a solar eclipse — when the world goes dark for a few minutes in the middle of the day? 
Scientifically speaking, the dark spot itself is easy to explain [32]: it is the shadow of the moon streaking across the earth.
This happens every year or two, each time along a different and, to all intents and purposes, a seemingly random piece of
the globe.
In the past people often interpreted an eclipse as a danger signal heralding disaster and in fact, the Chinese were so 
disturbed by these events that they included among their gods one whose job it was to prevent eclipses [33]. But whether 
or not you are superstitious or take a purely scientific view, our earthly eclipses are special in three ways.
Firstly, there can be no doubt that they are very beautiful. It's as if a deep blue curtain had fallen over the daytime sky as 
the sun becomes a black void surrounded by the glow of its outer atmosphere.
But beyond this, total eclipses possess a second more compelling beauty in the eves of us scientists, for they offer a 
unique opportunity for research [34]. Only during an eclipse can we study the corona and other dim things that are 
normally lost in the sun's glare.
And thirdly, they are rare. Even though an eclipse of the sun occurs somewhere on earth every year or two, if you sit in 
your garden and wait, it will take 375 years on average for one to come to you. If the moon were any larger, eclipses 
would become a monthly bore [35]: if it were smaller, they simply would not be possible.
The ancient Babylonian priests, who spent a fair bit of time staring at the sky, had already noted that there was an 18-year
pattern in their recurrence but they didn't have the mathematics to predict an eclipse accurately [36].",T007
Q9,"['Complete the table.', 'Date of \neclipse', 'Scientists', 'Observation', '1715', 'Halley', '37 __________ who accurately predicted an eclipse', '1868', 'Janssen and Lockyer', 'Discovered 38 __________', '1878', 'Watson', 'Believed he had found 39 __________', '1919', 'Einstein', 'Realised astronomers had misunderstood 40 \n__________']","['first person', '(a)new element/helium', '(the) lost planet/(the) new planet/Vulcan', 'gravity']","It was Edmund Halley, the English astronomer, who knew his maths well enough to predict the return of the comet which, incidentally 
bears his name, and in 1715 he became the first person to make an accurate eclipse prediction [37].
This brought eclipses firmly into the scientific domain and they have since allowed a number of important scientific 
discoveries to be made. For instance, in the eclipse of 1868 two scientists, Janssen and Lockyer, were observing the sun's
atmosphere and it was these observations that ultimately led to the discovery of a new element [38]. They named the 
element helium after the Greek god of the sun. This was a major find, because helium turned out to be the most common 
element in the universe after hydrogen. Another great triumph involved Mercury. I'll just put that up on the board for you 
now. See — there's Mercury — the planet closest to the Sun - then Venus, Earth, etc. For centuries, scientists had been 
unable to understand why Mercury appeared to rotate faster than it should. Some astronomers suggested that there might 
be an undiscovered planet causing this unusual orbit and even gave it the name 'Vulcan'. During the eclipse of 1878, an 
American astronomer, James Watson, thought he had spotted this so-called 'lost' planet [39]. But, alas for him, he was 
later obliged to admit that he had been wrong about Vulcan and withdrew his claim.
Then Albert Einstein came on the scene. Einstein suggested that rather than being wrong about the number of planets, 
astronomers were actually wrong about gravity [40]. Einstein's theory of relativity - for which he is so famous - 
disagreed with Newton's law of gravity in just the right way to explain Mercury's odd orbit. He also realised that a 
definitive test would be possible during the total eclipse of 1919 and this is indeed when his theory was finally proved 
correct.",T001

Luisa: Yes?

Luisa: No, that’s fine.
Interviewer: Lovely. The survey is on behalf of the local council. They’d like to know about what transport you use and 
any suggestions for improvement. Can I start by asking you how you travelled to town today?
Luisa: Sure. I came on the bus.

Interviewer: Now in this last section I’d like you to give us some ideas about the facilities and arrangements in the city 
for getting to and from work, er, any suggestions you have for improvements.
Luisa: Well, something I’ve thought about for some time is that when I do walk and I’m doing a later shift, I think the 
lighting should be better [6].
Interviewer: Yes, good point.
Luisa: And of course, I think it’s a real shame they’ve been cutting down on the number of footpaths. They should have 
more of those. Then people would walk more.
Interviewer: Yes, right.
Luisa: And, I don’t think there are enough trains. That’s why I don’t use them - you have to wait so long [7].
Interviewer: Thanks. And finally I’d like to ask your opinion on cycling. As you may know, there’s a drive in the city to 
get more people to cycle to work.
Luisa: Right.
Interviewer: But we realise that there are things which the council, but also employers, might do to help encourage 
workers to cycle to work.
Luisa: Yep. Well, I have thought about it and where I work there are no safe places to leave your bikes [8].
Interviewer: OK.
Luisa: And also, I’d have to cycle uphill and on a hot day I’d arrive at work pretty sweaty so I think I’d need a shower 
somewhere at work [9].
Interviewer: Right.
Luisa: And I suppose the last thing is that I wouldn’t be all that confident about cycling on such busy roads. I think I'd 
like to see you offering training for that [10], you know, I’d feel a lot better about starting if that was the case.

I’m very pleased to have this opportunity to say a little about two exciting new developments 
in the city: the Brackenside Open-Air Swimming Pool and the children’s Adventure Playground in Central Park. As 
many of you may know, the idea for these initiatives came from you, the public [11], in the extensive consultation 
exercise which the City Council conducted last year. And they have been realised using money from the SWRDC - the 
South West Regional Development Commission.
First of all, Brackenside Pool. As many of the older members of the audience will remember, there used to be a 
wonderful open-air pool on the sea front 30 years ago but it had to close when it was judged to be unsafe. For the design 
of this new heated pool, we were very happy to secure the talents of internationally renowned architect Ellen Wendon, 
who has managed to combine a charming 1930s design, which fits in so well with many of the other buildings in the 
area, with up-to-the-minute features such as a recycling system - the only one of its kind in the world - which enables 
seawater to be used in the pool [12].
Now, there has been quite a bit of discussion in the local press about whether there would be enough room for the 
number of visitors we’re hoping to attract [13], but the design is deceptive and there have been rigorous checks about 
capacity. Also, just in case you were wondering, we’re on schedule for a June 15th opening date and well within budget: 
a testimony to the excellent work of local contractors Hickman’s.
We hope that as many people as possible will be there on June 15th. We have engaged award winning actress Coral 
White to declare the pool open and there’ll be drinks and snacks available at the pool side. There'll also be a competition 
for the public to decide on the sculpture we plan to have at the entrance: you will decide which famous historical figure 
from the city we should have [14].",T005

for safety: the news came through only last week. The unique design is based on the concept of the Global Village, with 
the playground being divided into six areas showing different parts of the world - each with a representative feature. For 
example, there is a section on Asia, and this is represented by rides and equipment in the shape of snakes, orangutans, 
tigers and so on 
 
 
 - fauna native to the forests of the region.
 
 [15]
Moving south to the Antarctic - we couldn’t run to an ice rink I’m afraid but opted instead for climbing blocks in the 
shape of mountains [16] - I thought they could have had slides for the glaciers but the designers did want to avoid being 
too literal! Then on to South America - and here the theme is El Dorado - games replicating the search for mines full of 
precious stones [17]. And then moving up to North America, here there was considerable debate, I know the contribution 
of cinema and jazz was considered but the designers finally opted for rockets and the International Space Station [18]. 
Eastwards to Europe then, and perhaps the most traditional choice of all the areas: medieval castles and other 
fortifications [19]. Then last, but not least, moving south to Africa and a whole set of wonderful mosaics to represent the 
great rivers [20] of this fascinating and varied continent.
Now, the opening date for our Global Playground is 10th July. And again we'd love to see you there - so make a date and 
come and see this magnificent, original new amenity right in the heart of the city.",T006

Olivia: Yeah, he preferred to learn about nature by listening to his mother read to him. And quite early on he knew he

between the islands and the nearest inhabited land[25].

actually possible. And another communities lying to the east of Polynesia. But Heyerdahl knew they made lots of coastal 
voyages in locally built canoes.
Victor: Yes, or sailing on rafts, as was shown by the long voyage that Heyerdahl did next. It was an incredibly risky 
journey to undertake - sometimes I wonder if he did that trip for private reasons, you know? To show others that he could
have spectacular adventures. What do you think, Olivia?
Olivia: Well, I think it was more a matter of simply trying out his idea, to see if migration from the east was possible.
Victor: Yes, that's probably it [26]. And the poor guy suffered a bit at that time because the war forced him to stop his 
work for some years...
Olivia: Yes. When he got started again and planned his epic voyage, do you think it was important to him that he achieve
it before anyone else did?
Victor: Uhm, I haven’t read anywhere that that was his motivation. The most important factor seems to have been that he
use only ancient techniques and local materials to build his raft [27].
Olivia: Yes. I wonder how fast it went.
Victor: Well, it took them 97 days from South America to the Pacific Islands.
Olivia: Mm. And after that, Heyerdahl went to Easter Island, didn't he? We should mention the purpose of that trip. I 
think he sailed there in a boat made out of reeds.
Victor: No, that was later on in Egypt, Olivia.
Olivia: Oh, yes, that’s right.
Victor: But what he wanted to do was talk to the local people about their old stone carvings and then make one himself 
to learn more about the process[28].
Olivia: I see. Well, what a great life. Even though many of his theories have been disproven, he certainly left a lasting 
impression on many disciplines, didn’t he? To my mind, he was the first person to establish what modern academics call 
practical archaeology. I mean, that they try to recreate something from the past today , like he did with his raft trip[29]. 
It’s unfortunate that his ideas about where Polynesians originated from have been completely discredited.
Victor: Yes. Right, well, I'll prepare a PowerPoint slide at the end that acknowledges our sources. I mainly used The Life
and Work of Thor Heyerdahl by William Oliver. I thought the research methods he used were very sound, although I 
must say I found the overall tone somewhat old-fashioned. I think they need to do a new, revised edition[30].
Olivia: Yeah, I agree. What about the subject matter - I found it really challenging!
Victor: Well, it's a complex issue...
Olivia: I thought the book had lots of good points. What did you think of...",T007

Narrator: Well, I’ve been talking to managers in a number of businesses, and reading surveys about the future of 
management. And what I'm going to present in this seminar is a few ideas about how the activity is likely to change in 
the next ten years. It isn't a scientific, statistical analysis - just some ideas for us to discuss.
One area I want to mention is business markets, and I’m sure a really significant development will be a major increase in 
competition [31], with companies from all round the world trying to sell similar products.
Consumers will have much more choice - for instance, food products sold in Australia might be manufactured in the 
USA, China, Finland and dozens of other countries. At the same time, mergers and takeovers mean that governments are 
actually losing power to major global corporations [32].
We can probably all think of companies that exert a great deal of influence, which may be good for consumers.
A third point I want to make about markets is that in the rapidly expanding economies, such as India, China, Brazil and 
Russia, demand is growing very fast [33].
This is putting pressure on resources all over the world. I think businesses are becoming more open to external 
influences. In particular, companies are consulting customers more and more before making their business decisions 
[34]. Companies are finding out what they want and providing it, instead of making products and then trying to sell them,
which is the model of years ago.
Another influence is that concerns about the environment will force manufacturers to extend product, life cycles, to 
reduce the amount of pollution and waste. And in some cases, regulation will need to be strengthened [35].
Many societies are much more fluid and democratic, and the structure of companies is changing to reflect that. I think 
we're going to see a greater emphasis within companies on teams created with a specific project in mind [36]. And when 
they're completed, the teams will be disbanded and new ones formed.
More and more people see work as simply one part of their lifestyle, and not the most important one, and as the 
workforce is shrinking in some countries, businesses are having to compete for staff instead of being able to choose 
among a lot of applicants. Typical examples that will attract and retain staff are traditional ones like flexible hours and - 
something that has been made possible by advances in technology - remote working [37], with people based at their 
home, abroad, or almost anywhere they choose.
Management styles will almost certainly continue to change. Senior managers will require a lot more than the efficiency 
that they’ve always needed. Above all they'll need great skills in leadership [38], so that their organisation can initiate 
and respond to change in a fast-moving world, where they face lots of competing requirements and potential conflicts.
In most of the world, the senior managers of large businesses are mainly men in their fifties and sixties. The predominant
style of management will almost certainly become more consultative and collaborative, caused above all, by more 
women moving into senior management positions [39].
Many of the changes are influenced by developments in the wider economy. The traditional emphasis of business was 
manufacturing, and of course the service sector is very important. But we shouldn’t overlook the growing financial 
contribution of IP, that is, intellectual property. Some books and films generate enormous sums from the sale of related 
DVDs, music, games, clothes, and so on.
Another point I’d like to make is that although I’ve been talking about companies, one trend that they have to face is the 
move away from people working for the same employer for years. Instead, more and more people are becoming self-
employed [40], to gain the freedom and control over their lives that they’re unlikely to get from being employed.",T011

Welcome to the Early Learning Childcare Centre. How may I help you?
Caller: Hi. I spoke to you last week about enrolling my daughter for next year.
R: Oh, yes. I’ll just get some details from you. So, you're her mother?
C: That’s right.
R: And, can I have your name?
C: It’s Carol, Carol Smith.
R: And your daughter’s name?
C: It's Kate.
R: Now, we have several groups at the centre and we cater for children from three to five years old. How old is your 
daughter?
C: She’s three now but she turns four next month.
R: I’ll put four down because that's how old she'll be when she starts. 
C: Fine, she’s so excited about her birthday and coming to the centre.
R: That’s good to hear. And what's your address?
C: It’s 46 Wombat Road, that's W-O-M-B-A-T , Woodside 4032.
R: And what’s the phone number?
C: Oh... it’s... 3345 9865.
R: So, have you decided on the days you’d like to bring your daughter here?
C: I’d prefer Monday and Wednesday if possible.
R: Hmm. I'll check, Monday’s fine, but I think the centre is already full for Wednesday. Uhm. Yes. Sorry. It seems to be a
very popular day. We can offer you a Thursday or a Friday as well.
C: Oh dear. I suppose Thursday would be all right because she has swimming on Friday.
R: OK, got that. Because a lot of parents work, we do offer flexible start and finish times. We are open from 7:30 in the 
morning until 6 o'clock at night.
What time would you like your daughter to start?
C: I need to get to work in the city by 9:00 so I'll drop her off at 8:30 . You’re pretty close to the city here so that 
should give me plenty of time to get there.
R: That’s fine. Now, we also need to decide which group she'll be in. We have two different groups and they’re divided 
up according to age. There’s the green group, which is for three to four-year-olds. And then there’s the red group which is
for four- to five-year-olds.
C: She’s quite mature for her age and she can already write her name and read a little.
R: Well, I’ll put her in the red group and we can always change her to the green one if there are any problems.
C: That sounds fine.
R: OK. Let's move on to meals. We can provide breakfast, lunch and dinner. As she’s finishing pretty early, she won't 
need dinner, will you give her breakfast before she comes?
C: Yes, she'll only need lunch. 
R: Now, does she have any medical conditions we need to know about? Does she have asthma or any hearing problems 
for example?
C: No. But she does need to wear glasses. 
R: Oh, I'll make a note of that.
C: Yes, she's pretty good about wearing them, she can’t see much without them.
R: Right. OK. Now, I also need emergency contact details.
C: So what sort of information do you need?
R: Just the name and number of a friend or family member we can contact in case we can’t get hold of you at any time.
C: That’d better be my sister... Jenny Ball . That’s B-A-double L . Her phone number is 3346 7523.
R: Great. So she is the child's aunt?
C: Yes, that’s right. 
R: I’ll make a note of that as well. Now, is there anything you’d like to ask?
C: What about payment? How much are the fees each term?
R: Well, for two days and the hours you’ve chosen, that will be $450 altogether.
C: OK, and do I have lo pay that now?
R: No, we send out invoices once the children start at the centre. You can choose to pay at the end of each term or we do 
offer a slightly discounted rate if you pay every month.
C: Oh. I’ll do that then . I find it easier to budget that way and I’m not used to the term dates just yet. 
R: Good, it makes it a lot simpler for us as well. Well, that’s everything.",T002
Q29,"['Which TWO things does Alice say about the Dolphin Conservation Trust?', 'A Children make up most of the membership', 'В It’s the country’s largest conservation organisation', 'C It helps finance campaigns for changes in fishing practices', 'D It employs several dolphin experts full-time', 'E Volunteers help in various ways']","['C', 'E']","Interviewer: Today we're pleased to have on the show Alice Bussell from the Dolphin Conservation Trust. Tell us about 
the Trust, Alice.
Alice: Well, obviously its purpose is to protect dolphins in seas all around the world. It tries to raise people’s awareness 
of the problems these marine creatures are suffering because of pollution and other threats. It started ten years ago and 
it’s one of the fastest growing animal charities in the country — although it's still fairly small compared with the big 
players in animal protection. We are particularly proud of the work we do in education — last year we visited a huge 
number of schools in different parts of the country, going round to talk to children and young people aged from five to 
eighteen. In fact, about thirty-five per cent of our members are children. The charity uses its money to support campaigns
— for example, for changes in fishing policy and so forth. 
It hopes soon to be able to employ its first full-time biologist — with dolphin expertise — to monitor populations. Of 
course, many people give their services on a voluntary basis and we now have volunteers working in observation, office 
work and other things. 
I should also tell you about the award we won from the Charity Commission last year — for our work in education. 
Although it’s not meant an enormous amount of money for us, it has made our activities even more widely publicised 
and understood. In the long term it may not bring in extra members but we’re hoping it'll have this effect.
Interviewer: Is it possible to see dolphins in UK waters?
Alice: Yes. In several locations. And we have a big project in the east part of Scotland. This has long been a haven for 
dolphins because it has very little shipping. However, that may be about to change soon because oil companies want to 
increase exploration there. We’re campaigning against this because, although there’ll be little pollution from oil, 
exploration creates a lot of underwater noise . It means the dolphins can’t rest and socialise. This is how I became 
interested in dolphin conservation in the first place.
I had never seen one and I hadn’t been particularly interested in them at school. Then I came across this story about a 
family of dolphins who had to leave their home in the Moray Firth because of the oil companies and about a child who 
campaigns to save them. I couldn't put the book down - I was hooked. 
Interviewer: I'm sure our listeners will want to find out what they can do to help. You mentioned the 'Adopt a Dolphin’ 
scheme. Can you tell us about that?
Alice: Of course! People can choose one of our dolphins to sponsor. They receive a picture of it and news updates. I’d 
like to tell you about four which are currently being adopted by our members: Moondancer, Echo, Kiwi and Samson. 
Unfortunately, Echo is being rather elusive this year and hasn't yet been sighted by our observers , but we remain 
optimistic that he’ll be out there soon. All the others have been out in force - Samson and Moondancer are often 
photographed together but it is Kiwi who's our real 'character' as she seems to love coming up close for the cameras and 
we've captured her on film hundreds of times .
They all have their own personalities - Moondancer is very elegant and curves out and into the water very smoothly, 
whereas Samson has a lot of energy - he’s always leaping out of the water with great vigour . You’d probably expect 
him to be the youngest - he's not quite - that’s Kiwi - but Samson’s the latest of our dolphins to be chosen for the scheme 
.
Kiwi makes a lot of noise so we can often pick her out straightaway. Echo and Moondancer are noisy too, but 
Moondancer's easy to find because she has a particularly large fin on her back , which makes her easy to identify. So,
yes, they're all very different.",T005

How's the course going?
Rob: Oh, hi, Mia. Yeah, great. I can’t believe the first term’s nearly over.
Mia: I saw your group’s performance last night at the student theatre. It was good.
Rob: Really? Yeah... but now we have to write a report on the whole thing, an in-depth analysis. I don't know where to 
start. Like, I have to write about the role I played, the doctor, how I developed the character.
Mia: Well, what was your starting point?
Rob: Er... my grandfather was a doctor before he retired, and I just based it on him.
Mia: OK, but how? Did you talk to him about it?
Rob: He must have all sorts of stories, but he never says much about his work, even now. He has a sort of authority 
though.
Mia: So how did you manage to capture that?
Rob: I’d... I’d visualise what he must have been like in the past, when he was sitting in his consulting room listening to 
his patients. 
Mia: OK, so that’s what you explain in your report.
Rob: Right.
Mia: Then there’s the issue of atmosphere - so in the first scene we needed to know how boring life was in the doctor's 
village in the 1950s, so when the curtain went up on the first scene in the waiting room, there was that long silence 
before anyone spoke. And then people kept saying the same thing over and over, like 'Cold, isn't it?' 
Rob: Yes, and everyone wore grey and brown, and just sat in a row.
Mia: Yes, all those details of the production.
Rob: And I have to analyse how I functioned in the group — what I found out about myself. I know I was so frustrated 
at times, when we couldn’t agree.
Mia: Yes. So did one person emerge as the leader?
Rob: Sophia did. That was OK — she helped us work out exactly what to do for the production. And that made me feel 
better . I suppose.
Mia: When you understood what needed doing?
Rob: Yes. And Sophia did some research, too. That was useful in developing our approach.
Mia: Like what?
Rob: Well, she found these articles from the 1950s about how relationships between children and their parents, or 
between the public and people like bank managers or the police were shifting .
Mia: Interesting. And did you have any practical problems to overcome?
Rob: Well, in the final rehearsal everything was going fine until the last scene — that’s where the doctor's first patient 
appears on stage on his own.
Mia: The one in the wheelchair?
Rob: Yes, and he had this really long speech, with the stage all dark except for one spotlight — and then that stuck 
somehow so it was shining on the wrong side of the stage ... but anyway we got that fixed, thank goodness.
Mia: Yes, it was fine on the night.
Rob: But while you're here, Mia, I wanted to ask you about the year abroad option. Would you recommend doing that?
Mia: Yes, definitely: It’s a fantastic chance to study in another country for a year.
Rob: I think I’d like to do it, but it looks very competitive - there’s only a limited number of places.
Mia: Yes, so next year when you are in the second year of the course, you need to work really hard in all your theatre 
studies modules. Only students with good marks get places — you have to prove that you know your subject really 
well.
Rob: Right. So how did you choose where to go?
Mia: Well. I decided I wanted a programme that would fit in with what I wanted to do after I graduate, so I looked for a 
university with emphasis on acting rather than directing for example . It depends on you.
Then about six months before you go, you have to email the scheme coordinator with your top three choices. I had a 
friend who missed the deadline and didn’t get her first choice, so you do need to get a move on at that stage . You’ll 
find that certain places are very popular with everyone.
Rob: And don’t you have to write a personal statement at that stage?
Mia: Yes.
Rob: Right. I'll get some of the final year students to give me some tips... maybe see if I can read what they wrote .
Mia: I think that's a very good idea. I don’t mind showing you what I did. And while you’re abroad don't make the 
mistake I made. I got so involved I forgot all about making arrangements for when I came back here for the final year.

Rob: Yes, and everyone wore grey and brown, and just sat in a row.
Mia: Yes, all those details of the production.
Rob: And I have to analyse how I functioned in the group — what I found out about myself. I know I was so frustrated 
at times, when we couldn’t agree.
Mia: Yes. So did one person emerge as the leader?
Rob: Sophia did. That was OK — she helped us work out exactly what to do for the production. And that made me feel 
better . I suppose.
Mia: When you understood what needed doing?
Rob: Yes. And Sophia did some research, too. That was useful in developing our approach.
Mia: Like what?
Rob: Well, she found these articles from the 1950s about how relationships between children and their parents, or 
between the public and people like bank managers or the police were shifting .
Mia: Interesting. And did you have any practical problems to overcome?
Rob: Well, in the final rehearsal everything was going fine until the last scene — that’s where the doctor's first patient 
appears on stage on his own.
Mia: The one in the wheelchair?
Rob: Yes, and he had this really long speech, with the stage all dark except for one spotlight — and then that stuck 
somehow so it was shining on the wrong side of the stage ... but anyway we got that fixed, thank goodness.
Mia: Yes, it was fine on the night.
Rob: But while you're here, Mia, I wanted to ask you about the year abroad option. Would you recommend doing that?
Mia: Yes, definitely: It’s a fantastic chance to study in another country for a year.
Rob: I think I’d like to do it, but it looks very competitive - there’s only a limited number of places.
Mia: Yes, so next year when you are in the second year of the course, you need to work really hard in all your theatre 
studies modules. Only students with good marks get places — you have to prove that you know your subject really 
well.
Rob: Right. So how did you choose where to go?
Mia: Well. I decided I wanted a programme that would fit in with what I wanted to do after I graduate, so I looked for a 
university with emphasis on acting rather than directing for example . It depends on you.
Then about six months before you go, you have to email the scheme coordinator with your top three choices. I had a 
friend who missed the deadline and didn’t get her first choice, so you do need to get a move on at that stage . You’ll 
find that certain places are very popular with everyone.
Rob: And don’t you have to write a personal statement at that stage?
Mia: Yes.
Rob: Right. I'll get some of the final year students to give me some tips... maybe see if I can read what they wrote .
Mia: I think that's a very good idea. I don’t mind showing you what I did. And while you’re abroad don't make the 
mistake I made. I got so involved I forgot all about making arrangements for when I came back here for the final year. 
Make sure you stay in touch so they know your choices for the optional modules .

approach different situations. Self-regulatory focus theory is a theory developed by Tory Higgins. He says that a person’s
focus at any given time is to either approach pleasure or avoid pain. These are two basic motivations that each and every 
one of us has, and they cause us to have different kinds of goals. Promotion goals in different life situations emphasise 
achievement . Prevention goals are oriented towards the avoidance of punishment.
In a specific situation, our thoughts might focus more on promotion goals or more on prevention goals. The theory 
suggests that two factors affect which goals we are focusing on. First, there is a chronic factor. This factor is connected to
a person's personality and says that each person has a basic tendency to either focus more on promotion goals or 
focus more on prevention goals as part of his or her personality. Second, there is a situational factor which means 
that the context we are in can make us more likely to focus on one set of goals or the other. For example, we are more 
likely to be thinking about pleasure and to have promotion goals when we are spending time with a friend . In 
contrast, if we are working on an important project for our boss, we are more likely to try to avoid making mistakes and 
therefore have more prevention goals in our mind.
Research has shown that the goals we are focusing on at a given time affect the way we think. For example, when 
focusing on promotion goals, people consider their ideal self, their aspirations and gains . They don't think about 
what they can lose, so they think in a happier mode. They feel more inspired to change. When people are focusing on 
prevention goals, they think about their “ought"" self. What are they supposed to be? What are people expecting from 
them? They consider their obligations to others. As a result, they experience more anxiety and try to avoid situations 
where they could lose.
Now that I have talked about the two focuses and how they affect people, I want to look at the idea that the way leaders 
behave, or their style of leading, can affect the focus that followers adopt in a specific situation.
In talking about leadership, we often mention transformational leaders and transactional leaders. Transformational 
leaders, when interacting with their followers, focus on their development . In their words and actions 
transformational leaders highlight change. Their speech is passionate and conveys a definitive vision . All of these 
things can encourage followers to think about what could be. In other words, they inspire a promotion focus in their 
followers.
In contrast, transactional leaders focus on developing clear structures that tell their followers exactly what is expected of 
them . While they do explain the rewards people will get for following orders, they emphasise more how a follower 
will be punished or that a follower won't get rewarded if his or her behaviour doesn’t change. In short, they emphasise 
the consequences of making a mistake. This emphasis will clearly lead followers to focus on avoiding punishment and 
problems. This is clearly a prevention focus.
In conclusion, it is important to understand that one focus is not necessarily better than the other one. For a designer who 
works in a field where a lot of innovation is needed, a promotion focus is probably better . In contrast, a prevention 
focus which causes people to work more cautiously and produce higher quality work might be very appropriate for a job 
like a surgeon, for example. The main point of the research, though, is that the actions of leaders can greatly influence 
whether people approach a situation with more of a promotion focus or more of a prevention focus.",T011

All the family can enjoy a day out at Manham: visit our copper mine, see models of the machinery it used, have your photo taken in nineteenth-century costume, experience at first hand how people lived at different stages throughout history, and especially how children studied, worked and played.
The port of Manham is located in beautiful and peaceful countryside, on a bend in the great River Avon, and developed here because it’s the highest navigable point of the Avon - boats can go no higher up this river - and proved a handy place to load and unload cargo [11] to and from the sea, which is over 23 miles away.
A small port was already established here when, about 900 years ago, tin was discovered nearby, though it wasn’t until the Industrial Revolution, when a tremendous need for metals of all kinds developed, that Manham expanded to become one of the busiest ports in the country [12].
And because it was already so busy, prospectors began to look for other minerals, and by the end of the nineteenth century, lead, copper, manganese and arsenic were added to the cargos leaving Manham.
In the early days, the ores had been smelted - or processed - in the same area they were mined. But, as demand grew, the smelting process required huge factory furnaces or fires to melt the metal from the rock and there was not enough coal in the local area, so the rocks containing minerals had to be shipped long distances [13].
Sadly, in the twentieth century, the great port of Manham declined, and thousands of workers were forced to emigrate out of the area [14]. The building at the port fell into disrepair, and the place became almost forgotten. But then, the Manham Trust was formed to conserve the historical resources of the area. It organised scores of local volunteers to remove undergrowth to find the original outlines of the installations. It then brought in paid professionals to match installations with maps of the original port complex and to set about reconstructing it [15].
Today you can see the results of this ambitious programme of restoration. The intention, and we believe this will be realised before the end of the year, is to return Manham Port to the condition it reached at its peak as 'the greatest copper port in the country’.",T007

Watch out especially for the great pumping machines which rid the mine of water. But please be warned that, like all mines, ours is very dark and closed in and we do say that children under five and also dogs should NOT be taken into the mine [17].
The next recommended visit is to the village school. While looking round the classrooms, take a special look at our display of games [18], which is one of the largest in the world.
And it's recommended that you time your visit to coincide with a guided tour [19]. This will give you the opportunity to ask lots of questions. Near the school is the beautiful old sailing ketch called ‘The George'. You are welcome to board the boat and look round the cabins. Look out for the ship’s wheel which was missing until only five years ago when it was dredged out of the silt by a local fisherman. We have no idea how it got there but it’s been polished and proudly restored to its original place on the boat. Please take care going down the ladders if you wish to visit the lower deck - we don’t recommend you allow young children to use them [20].

Laura: Hi, Tim. Sure.
Tim: Didn’t you do yours at an environmental services company?
Laura: That's right... It’s only a very small company and they needed someone to produce a company brochure, and I wanted to get some business experience because I’m interested in a career in occupational psychology in a business environment. It was good because I had overall responsibility for the project.
Tim: What kind of skills do you think you developed on the placement? I mean, apart from the ones you already had... Did you have to do all the artwork for the brochure, the layout and everything?
Laura: We hired the services of a professional photographer for that. I did have to use my IT skills to a certain extent because I cut and pasted text from marketing leaflets, but that didn't involve anything I hadn’t done before.
Tim: Do you think you got any better at managing your time and prioritising things? [21] You always used to say you had trouble with that...
Laura: Oh. definitely . There was so much pressure to meet the project deadline. And I also got better at explaining things and asserting my opinions [21, 22], because I had to have weekly consultations with the marketing manager and give him a progress report.

How do I go about it?
Laura: It's easy enough to do, because there’s a government agency called STEP - S-T-E-P - that organises placements for students. You should start by getting their booklet [25] with all the details - I expect you can download one from their website.
Tim: Actually, they’ve got copies in the psychology department [25] - I’ve seen them there. I'll just go to the office and pick one up.
Laura: Right. And then if I were you, after I’d looked at it I'd go over all the options with someone...
Tim: I suppose I should ask my tutor’s advice. He knows more about me than anyone.
Laura: One of the career officers would be better [26], they’ve got more knowledge about the jobs market than your personal tutor would have.
Tim: OK...
Laura:And then when you know what you want you can register with STEP - you’ll find their address in the booklet. And once you’ve registered they assign you to a mentor who looks after your application.
Tim:And then I suppose you just sit back and wait till you hear something? They told me at the careers office that it’s best to be proactive, and get updates yourself by checking the website for new placement alerts [27].
Laura: Your mentor is supposed to keep you informed, but you can't rely on that.
Tim:I don’t suppose it’s a good idea to get in touch with companies directly, is it?
Laura: Not really... But it is the company who notifies you if they want you to go for an interview. You get a letter of invitation or an email from personnel departments [28].
Tim:And do I reply directly to them?
Laura: Yes, you do STEP only gets involved again once you've been made a job offer.
Tim: Right... So, once you’ve had an interview you should let your mentor know what the outcome is? I mean whether you’re offered a job, and whether you’ve decided to accept it?
Laura: That’s right [29]. They'll inform the careers office once a placement has been agreed, so you don’t have to do that.
Tim:Is that all then?
Laura: More or less. Only once you’ve accepted an offer you’ll probably have to supply a reference [30], because the placement will be conditional on that.

Q42,"['31 The speaker says that one problem with nanotechnology is that', '32 According to the speaker, some scientists believe that nano-particles', ""33 In the speaker's opinion, research into nanotechnology""]","['C', 'B', 'C']","Narrator: Today we’re going to look at an important area of science, namely nanotechnology. So what is it? Nano means tiny, so it’s science and engineering on the scale of atoms and molecules. The idea is that by controlling and rearranging atoms, you can literally create anything. However, as we’ll see, the science of the small has some big implications affecting us in many ways.
There’s no doubt that nanotechnology promises so much for civilisation. However, all new technologies have their teething problems. And with nanotechnology, society often gets the wrong idea about its capabilities [31].
Numerous science-fiction books and movies have raised people's fears about nanotechnology - with scenarios such as inserting little nano-robots into your body that monitor everything you do without you realising it, or self-replicating nano-robots that eventually take over the world.
So how do we safeguard such a potentially powerful technology? Some scientists recommend that nano-particles be treated as new chemicals with separate safety tests and clear labelling [32].
They believe that greater care should also be taken with nano-particles in laboratories and factories [32]. Others have called for a withdrawal of new nano products such as cosmetics and a temporary halt to many kinds of nano-tech research. But as far as I’m concerned there's a need to plough ahead with the discoveries and applications of nanotechnology [33].
I really believe that most scientists would welcome a way to guard against unethical uses of such technology. We can’t go around thinking that all innovation is bad, all advancement is bad. As with the debate about any new technology, it is how you use it that’s important. So let’s look at some of its possible uses.",T007

These could be virtually unbreakable, lighter and much more pliable leading to planes that are 50 times lighter than at present. Those same improved capabilities will dramatically reduce the cost of travelling into space making it more accessible to ordinary people [35] and opening up a totally new holiday destination.
In terms of technology, the computer industry will be able to shrink computer parts down to minute sizes. We need nanotechnology in order to create a new generation of computers that will work even faster and will have a million times more memory [36] but will be about the size of a sugar cube.
Nanotechnology could also revolutionise the way that we generate power. The cost of solar cells will be drastically reduced so harnessing this energy will be far more economical [37] than at present.
But nanotechnology has much wider applications than this and could have an enormous impact on our environment. For instance, tiny airborne nano-robots could be programmed to actually rebuild the ozone layer, which could lessen the impact of global warming on our planet. That’s a pretty amazing thought, isn’t it? On a more local scale, this new technology could help with the clean-up of environmental disasters as nanotechnology will allow us to remove oil and other contaminants from the water far more effectively [38]. And, if nanotechnology progresses as expected - as a sort of building block set of about 90 atoms - then you could build anything you wanted from the bottom up. In terms of production, this means that you only use what you need and so there wouldn't be any waste [39].
The notion that you could create anything at all has major implications for our health. It means that we’ll eventually be able to replicate anything. This would have a phenomenal effect on our society. In time it could even lead to the eradication of famine through the introduction of machines that produce food to feed the hungry.
But it’s in the area of medicine that nanotechnology may have its biggest impact. How we detect disease will change as tiny biosensors are developed to analyse tests in minutes rather than days [40]. There’s even speculation nano-robots could be used to slow the ageing process, lengthening life expectancy.
As you can see, I’m very excited by the implications that could be available to us in the next few decades. Just how long it’ll take, I honestly don't know.",T011

How many were there? Well, only 473 Duesenberg J-types were ever built [11] and the model here is one of the rarest.
Each had a short 125-inch chassis or framework and the body was always in the form of an open two-seater [12] .
The technology behind the car's 6.9-litre engine was extraordinary. It featured capsules of mercury in the engines to absorb vibration and provide an incredibly smooth ride [13].
In fact, these cars offered unparalleled performance, in an age when 160 kilometres per hour was considered very fast, the Duesenberg promised a top speed of 180 kilometres per hour [14] and could do 140 kilometres per hour in second gear.
Duesenberg, who designed the car, sold it as a frame and engine [15] ... this was typical of the age again and many prestige manufacturers such as Rolls-Royce did exactly the same. Owners able to afford the hefty $9,000 price tag for the basic car would then commission a coachwork company to build a body tailored to their own individual requirements.
The Duesenberg's great attraction for the driver was its instrument panel which offered all the usual features but also several others including a stop-watch [16].
On to another celebrity, the 1922 Leyat Helica. Only 30 of these French propeller cars were built [17] and the model here at Goodwood, which was the fourth to be made, is thought to be the only surviving example still capable of running.
The brains behind this car was Marcel Leyat who was an aviation pioneer first and foremost, and the influence of flying is quite apparent in the car. The Leyat very strongly resembles a light aircraft [18] with its front propeller but in this case it's minus any wings [19] of course!
It's quite odd to think that this car was whirring through France, just as the Duesenberg was blasting down roads at 160 kilometres per hour across the Atlantic. The Leyats were used regularly in France in the 1920s and were even produced in saloon and van form, as well as two-seater. The Leyat matched its propeller drive with its equally bizarre steering which used the rear rather than the front wheels [20]! But despite looking rather frail, it was a tough machine.",T011

Rosie: As you probably know, the Complex and the Park show all the latest films, while the late-night cinema tends to show cult films. So, when we interviewed the students, we thought the Complex would be the most popular choice of cinema ... but surprisingly it was the late-night Odeon [24] .
Mike: Yeah, and most students said that if they wanted to see a new film, they waited for it to show at the Park because the complex is more expensive and further out of town so you have to pay more to get there as well.
Tutor: Yes, and that adds to the cost, of course, and detracts from the popularity [24], evidently .
Rosie: What we did find that was very interesting is that there are periods during the year when students seem to go to the theatre and periods when they go to the cinema and we really think that's to do with budget. If you look at this graph, you can see that there's a peak around November/December when they go to the theatre more and then a period in April/ May when neither is particularly popular [26] and then theatre viewing seems to trail off virtually while the cinema becomes quite popular in June/July [26] .",T007

As you know, dust storms have always been a feature of desert climates, but what we want to focus on today is the extent to which human activity is causing them [31].
So - what are these human activities ? Well, there are two main types that affect the wind erosion process, and thus the frequency of dust storms. There are activities that break up naturally wind-resistant surfaces such as off-road vehicle use and construction and there are those that remove protective vegetation cover from soils, for example, mainly farming and drainage.

The dramatic rise in the number of dust storms during the latter part of that decade was the result of farmers mismanaging their land. In fact, choking dust storms became so commonplace that the decade became known as the 'Dirty Thirties'. [33]
In places like Arizona, the most dangerous dust clouds are those generated by dry thunderstorms. [34] Here, this type of storm is so common that the problem inspired officials to develop an alert system to warn people of oncoming thunderstorms. When this dust is deposited it causes all sorts of problems for machine operators. [35] It can penetrate the smallest nooks and crannies and play havoc with the way things operate because most of the dust is made up of quartz which is very hard.
Another example - the concentration of dust originating from the Sahara has risen steadily since the mid-1960s.
This increase in wind erosion has coincided with a prolonged drought, [36] which has gripped the Sahara's southern fringe. Drought is commonly associated with an increase in dust-raising activity but it's actually caused by low rainfall which results in vegetation dying off.",T001

You do have over a hundred to choose 
from, they're mostly sandy beaches and they vary from the largest which is two and a half kilometres long, to tiny sandy 
coves. But there are a few that I'd really recommend you to visit.
So looking at this pamphlet, first of all there's Bandela beach. This beach is one kilometre away from the old fishing 
village of Bandela [11], which is a beautiful spot. If you park in the car park behind it, there's a small path which leads 
down to the bay. It's very pretty because the whole beach is backed by pine trees [12] so its very sheltered. The beach 
itself is very clean and the water is shallow and safe. That together with the soft sand make it an ideal beach for children 
and non-swimmers.
A little further round the coast, again to the east, in the eastern corner of the island, is the spectacular Da Porlata beach 
which is basically a long inlet. The land around this beach is marshland, it's all marsh [13], and there's a stream which 
winds through it and the stream goes into the sea, and the beach has lovely pale gold sand. Access to this beach is quite 
tricky and not for the less energetic! You have to go down a long flight of steps - 190 to be exact. But you'll be relieved 
to know that there's also a road which winds down to a car parking area. When you're level with the sea, there is a 
handful of shops and bars and you can hire sunbeds and umbrellas [14] .
Continuing round the island, just past the Tip of Cain is the next beach I'd suggest you visit and this is San Gett. Why? 
Because there isn't a beach longer than this on the island [15]. If you want to know, it's exactly two and a half kilometres 
long and that's a bonus because it means it never gets overcrowded. It has golden sand and clear, blue water shelving into
the sea. There are several beach restaurants to choose from and watersports are available when the water is calm. But 
check first. This beach operates a flag system [16] as the sea can get rough and you should always swim between the 
flags. There's a large car park which gives you easy access to the eastern end of the beach but the western end is much 
quieter and more wild as it is harder to reach.
Blanaka is another popular beach — just in the north-west corner of the island [17]. It has incredibly white sand and 
sparkling water. There is ample car parking here and plenty of bars and restaurants. Blanaka has white cliffs all around it 
[18] and for those of you who'd like a little more to do than just lazing on the beach, there are caves here which you can 
explore in the cliffs and you can also dive into the water from rock platforms along the side of the cove.
Well, my final recommendation for today is Dissidor. Now this beach isn't quite as easy to get to as the others I've talked 
about. It's quite a remote little beach tucked away here next to Blanaka. You can reach Dissidor by a steep slope which 
goes over some sandbanks [19] . The beach itself is small and pretty, with reddish-coloured sand and some stony areas on
its eastern side. Despite being quite small the bathing is good and you can also go fishing here from the rocks at either 
side. It's a good idea to take some food and drink with you [20] if you decide to go here as there's only one little bar 
which isn't always open.",T001

Lee Rogers talks to one major book store 
manager.
Lee: Jenny Farrow, you're the manager of Dalton Books - and you sell an awful lot of books to students, don't you?
Jenny: Yes! We do.
Lee: How do you manage to make sure that you're going to have the books students need when all the new courses 
begin?
Jenny: Basically, we make preparations long before they arrive. Like all other major book retailers, we have a database 
of information, and using that, we contact course conveners in May and ask them to send us their booklists [21].
Lee: How many books are we talking about?
Jenny: For one course?
Lee: Yes, as an example.
Jenny: An average course requires about 30 books. We ask lecturers to indicate whether a book is what we call 'essential'
reading... you know, the students simply have to get it, or whether it's what they would term 'recommended' reading 
[22]or whether it's just a supplementary text that they tend to refer to as 'background' reading.
Lee: What about predicted buyers?
Jenny: It's not a perfect system unfortunately. If a lecturer tells us that he expects us to sell 100 copies of a book, we 
know that we could actually sell anything from 50 to 150. That's why in practice, when it comes to ordering, it's a lot 
safer to go by the previous year's sales figures [23] - if that's possible of course... if we've sold the book before. We also 
build other factors into the equation including the type of course that the books are for, the students' year group [24] and 
a measure of our own judgement.
Lee: And these criteria make a fairly accurate guide?
Jenny: As accurate as we can be, yes.
Lee: What about the publishers? Do they take an active role in promoting new books?
Jenny: Certainly. The academic and professional publishing market is worth about £700 million a year, so publishers go 
to some lengths to make sure their books are known. The standard procedure they use is to mail out catalogues to 
lecturers or colleges and universities [25], that's been the main form of promotion for years. Now, of course, they can 
also post details of new or revised works on websites. Some even go so far as writing individual letters to the appropriate
lecturers [26] in order to let them know what's coming up.
Lee: The lecturers then contact you if they're interested ...
Jenny: That's right. The publishers send us - the book sellers - 'inspection copies' [27]. Lecturers can then get a free copy
and decide whether it's going to be suitable for their course.
Lee: And how does it work with the students? What are they looking for and who helps them most?
Jenny: I think lecturers are best placed to understand the students' needs. Often the critical issue is what represents value 
for money for students [28]. This is more important than price per se.
Lee: Do students actually buy books before they start the course?
Jenny: Apparently a large proportion of students wait to see what they need. Students have a firm idea of what 
constitutes a good book so they tend to give themselves time to look at all the options before making a choice.
They tend to go for books that are clear and easy to use [29,30] . Often the texts that their lecturers recommend turn out 
to be too academic and remain here on our shelves.",T011

became more objective]. I was no longer producing images from the heart but developing images for a specified 
subject, taking a more practical approach . I began to develop a collection of my illustrations which I put into a portfolio 
and started to carry around with me to show prospective clients and employers. But it was still tricky because publishers, 
for example, want to know that your drawings will reproduce well in a book, but without having had any work published,
it's hard to prove this [35]. Having a wonderful portfolio or collection of original artwork is, of course, a first step but 
what most potential clients would like to see is printed artwork and without this 'evidence' they tend to hold back still

And I suppose this is my advice to you on preparing your portfolio of your 
best work. The first way was by submitting my work for a competition [36], and the one I chose was for a horoscope 
design and was sponsored by a top women's magazine. There are a few of these competitions each year and they offer 
new illustrators an opportunity to showcase their work. The other approach I took was to design and print some mock-up 
pages of a book [37]. In other words, I placed some of my illustrations next to some text in order to demonstrate how my 
work would look when it was printed.
Perhaps I was lucky in that I had taken a degree that provided me with all-round creative skills so that I could vary my 
style and wasn't limited to a certain technique [38]. I think that is important. The art world, and many other creative 
fields, do try to pigeon-hole people into snug boxes with an accompanying label. I think you should try to resist this if 
you feel it happening to you. If you don't, you'll find it difficult to have new work accepted if you try to develop your 
style at a later stage in your career. Nevertheless, when you start out and particularly when you're going for an interview, 
it's important not to confuse people by having a lot of different examples in your portfolio. One remedy for this is to 
separate your work into distinct categories [39]. In my case, I did this by dividing my design-inspired illustrations from 
my paintings. It is then easier to analyse the market suited to each portfolio; such as magazines, book jackets, CD covers 
etc. Working under two names is also useful [40] as it clarifies the different approaches and offers a distinction between 
them.",T011

Man: Right ... And the race is to help raise money for charity?
Woman: It is. We're asking every team member to try and raise £35 by getting friends and/or relatives to sponsor them. Every crew member will receive a free tournament t-shirt if your team manages to raise £1,000 or more [4].
Man: Oh that's quite good.
Woman: Also we're holding a raffle — every crew member who takes part in the race this season will be entered into a free prize draw.
Man: Oh, what's the prize?
Woman: It's pretty good - it's a holiday in Hong Kong [5].
Man: Sounds great!
Woman: Is there anything else you need to know?
Man: Could you just tell me a little bit more about the teams?
Woman: Well, you need to have a crew of 20 people for your dragon boat and you then need to agree on who's going to be the team captain [6]. That would probably be you.
Man: Fine. Urn, I've got a group of 20 people who are interested. Do all the team members have to be a certain age?
Woman: Well there's no age limit as such but if you have a team member who's under 18 then they have to get their parents' permission [7] to take part.
Man: Yes, that makes sense.
Woman: It isn't dangerous but we do have boats that turn over in the water and for that reason we insist that everyone wears a life jacket as well and you can hire life jackets from us [8] when your team arrives.
Man: What do you advise people to wear?
Woman: Well, most people wear a t-shirt, shorts and trainers. I certainly wouldn't recommend that you wear jeans or boots. In fact, it's a very good idea to bring some spare clothes [9].
Man: OK.
Woman: It can get quite cold and wet if the weather's bad. And there's quite a bit of hanging around especially if you qualify for the semi-finals or the final.
Man: I see what you mean.
Woman: Have you got a name for your team? [10]

My job is to tell you all about the amazing little kiwi - and your job, hopefully, is to dig deep in your pockets.
Now for the benefit of our overseas visitors here today, I should explain first of all that the kiwi is the national bird of New Zealand - and sometimes New Zealanders themselves are known as 'Kiwis'. Now, while kiwis in the wild are a rare sight, the kiwi as a symbol is far more visible. Apart from being in toy stores and airport shops all over the world, you'll find them on our stamps and coins [11]. The kiwi is the smallest member of the genus Apteryx which also includes ostriches and emu. It gets its name from its shrill call [12] which sounds very much like this - kee-wee. Kiwis live in forests or swamps and feed on insects, worms, snails and berries. It's a nocturnal bird with limited sight and therefore it has to rely on its very keen sense of smell [13] to find food and to sense danger. Its nostrils are actually right on the end of its long beak which is one third of the body length. Now here's an interesting fact. Although kiwis have wings, they serve little purpose because the kiwi is a flightless bird [14].
Since white settlement of the islands, kiwi numbers have dropped from 12 million to less than 70,000 and our national bird is rapidly becoming an endangered species. This is because they're being threatened by what we call introduced animals animals [15] which were brought to New Zealand such as cats and ferrets which eat kiwi eggs and their chicks.",Note Completion

It works like this: It's a three- stage process. First of all, we go out to the kiwi's natural habitat and we collect kiwi eggs [18]. This is the tricky part because it can be very difficult to find the eggs. Then, in safe surroundings, away from predators the chicks are reared [19] . Now this can be done on predator-free islands or in captivity - they're reared until they are about nine months old at which stage the chicks are returned to the wild. So far it's proving successful and since we started the programme some 34 chicks have been successfully raised this year and their chances of survival have increased from 5 to 85% [20]. However, it's not time to celebrate kiwi survival just yet. About 95% of kiwi chicks still don't make it to six months of age without protection.

I believe questions are quite welcome throughout.
Professor: Thank you. Well, I know you're all very familiar with the super highway here in Melbourne. But do super highways automatically lead to super wealth, as our politicians would have us believe? I think not.
Tutor: Can you give us an example of what you mean exactly?
Professor: Sure. Well, by continuing to encourage this dependence on the motor car, we simply create more congestion and more urban sprawl [21]. And you can see that here in Melbourne right under your nose.
Student: Excuse me. I would just like to say that I feel the sprawl is part of the city. The freeways mean people can enjoy the benefits of living away from the centre, on larger blocks with gardens, but still be able to drive back into the city centre for work or entertainment [22 - the whole saying summarises student's positive attitude to urban sprawl].
Professor: Well I'm not convinced that people want to do that. And is our money being well spent? It may be OK for you now but come back to me in five years' time! Let's take City Link, for example, the new freeway here in Melbourne.
Student: Well, I use the freeway all the time. I think it's great.
Professor: Ah yes, but it cost 2 billion dollars to build, and you could have gotten ten times the value by putting the money into public transport. If you give the automobile road space, it will fill that space, and you'll soon find you'll be crawling along your City Link [23].
Tutor: But surely, you cannot simply blame the car. Some of the blame must rest with governments and city planners?
Student: Well there is an argument, surely, that building good roads is actually beneficial because most new cars these days are highly efficient - they use far less petrol than in the past and emissions of dangerous gases are low [24]. Old congested roads, on the other hand, encourage traffic to move slowly and it's the stationary cars that cause the pollution and smog, whereas good roads increase traffic speeds and thus the amount of time cars are actually on the roads.",Multiple Choice

They also built cycle lanes and now 30% of the inhabitants of Copenhagen use a bicycle to go to work. Sydney by comparison can only boast 1% of the population cycling to work.

Well, apart from keeping it fresh for our daily needs, many foods, such as fruit and vegetables are only available at certain times of the year so if we want to be able to eat these foods all year round, we need to preserve them. We also need to preserve food for export overseas to make sure that it doesn't perish in transit [31], and lastly we need to be able to preserve food for when there are food shortages [32].

This involves heating milk to just 65°C for 30 minutes. A new method, the ultra-high temperature or UHT process, involves heating milk to 150°C for three seconds. The advantage of treating milk in this way is that it lasts much longer [33] though I tend to feel, and I'm sure many of you would agree, that taste is somewhat sacrificed in the UHT process.
Tin cans were first used in the early 1800s to store and preserve food. Just as they are now, the cans were tin-plated, steel containers and the process had the advantage of being cost effective. Unfortunately, however, there were many early cases of food-poisoning [34] because the canning process was not fully understood at that stage. We now know the exact temperature and length of time each food needs for proper preservation which has greatly reduced the risk of food-poisoning.
People living in cold climates often preserved food by burying it in the snow and the Romans knew all about the advantages of packing food in ice but for most people this was not an option until the invention of the refrigerator in 1834. Today, however, refrigeration is the most important means of preserving food because the food stays fresh without needing to be treated. However, refrigeration requires an electricity supply and unfortunately if the power goes off, so does the food [35]!
A variety of chemicals can be added to food and you'll find their names listed on the labels of cans and bottles. Salt is probably the oldest of all the chemical preservatives and was used by many ancient civilisations for many years. Sugar also acts as a preservative and is used to preserve jams in much the same way that vinegar is used to pickle foods. Chemical preservatives are effective [36] but they do not suit all foods and the processes involved are time- consuming.
Another method of preserving food is by drying it. Most foods are 75% to 90% water so if you remove the water the micro-organisms simply can't survive. When food is dried it not only lasts a long time but it also becomes much lighter which is a big advantage as this makes it cheap to store [37], though some people argue that valuable nutrients are lost in the process. Early methods for drying food involved cutting it into strips and hanging it in the sun or over fires. But there are now a number of more modern methods which involve the use of recent technology. One of these is known as roller drying and it's a highly effective way of making dried foods from liquids, such as soup.",Table Completion

German shepherds make excellent guard dogs and are also very appropriate as search and rescue [16] dogs working in disaster zones after earthquakes and avalanches. And so that they can be sent anywhere in the world to assist in disaster relief operations, effective dogs and their trainers are now listed on an international database [17]. In order to be effective, a good detector dog must have an enormous food drive - in other words they must really love their food [18].
