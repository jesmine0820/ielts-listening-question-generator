NARRATOR: You will hear a conversation between Liam, a university student, and Dr. Evans, an academic advisor, discussing Liam's first-year lecture schedule. You will have a moment to read the questions before the recording begins.

LIAM: Good morning, Dr. Evans. My name is Liam Thompson, and I have an appointment to discuss my first-year lecture timetable. I just wanted to make sure I have all the correct information.

DR. EVANS: Ah, Liam, yes, do come in and sit down. I have your provisional schedule here. Let's go through it together. It's always a good idea to double-check these things.

LIAM: Thank you. So, the first one on my list is 'Introduction to Biology' with Professor Davis. It's on Monday at 10 AM in the Main Building, Room 201. That's compulsory, right?

DR. EVANS: That's absolutely correct, Liam. That one is a foundational module for all science students. No changes there.

LIAM: Great. Next is 'Modern European History' with Dr. Anya Sharma. Tuesday at 11 AM. My schedule says Arts Faculty, but it doesn't specify the room number. Do you have that?

DR. EVANS: Let me see. Yes, for Dr. Sharma's history lecture, it was initially listed for Room 101, but that room is undergoing renovations this semester. It's now in the Arts Faculty, Room 105. I'll make a note for you.

LIAM: Room 105, got it. Thanks. Then there's 'Quantitative Methods' with Dr. Thompson. That's on Wednesday, but the time is blank on my sheet. And it also says something about bringing a specific item.

DR. EVANS: Ah, yes, for Quantitative Methods. It's a very practical session. It was originally scheduled for 10 AM, but Dr. Thompson found that students had conflicting modules, so he moved it. It's now on Wednesday at 9:00 AM. And yes, you absolutely must bring a calculator to that lecture. A scientific one is best, not just your phone's calculator.

LIAM: Nine AM, and a calculator. Noted. What about 'Philosophy of Science' with Dr. Eva Green? My timetable just shows the time as 2 PM in the Arts Faculty, Room 102, but the day is missing.

DR. EVANS: The Philosophy of Science lecture is actually quite popular and sometimes clashes with other core subjects. For this semester, Dr. Green will be delivering it on Thursday afternoons. So, every Thursday at 2 PM.

LIAM: Thursday. Okay. That works for me. And then there's 'Academic Writing Skills' with Ms. Rachel Lee. It's on Friday, Main Building, Room 203. Again, the time is missing, and it mentions covering referencing but then a blank.

DR. EVANS: Yes, Ms. Lee's academic writing session is crucial for developing your essay skills. It’s held on Friday afternoons, starting at 1:00 PM. And you're right, it covers referencing, but its main focus is on how to structure and write academic essays. It's very hands-on, so be prepared to do some writing during the session.

LIAM: One PM, and it covers essays. Excellent. Finally, 'Environmental Science' with Dr. Kevin Price. Thursday at 3 PM. I don't have a location for that one, and it also says 'sign up by' a certain date.

DR. EVANS: Environmental Science is an optional lecture, but highly recommended. It will be held in the new Science Building, which is located just past the main library. And yes, because it's optional, they need a headcount. You need to sign up for that module by the end of this week, so by Friday. If you're interested, make sure you do that.

LIAM: The Science Building, and sign up by Friday. Got it. This has been really helpful, Dr. Evans. Thank you so much for clarifying everything.

DR. EVANS: You're most welcome, Liam. If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to come back. And good luck with your first semester!

LIAM: Thanks, Dr. Evans.

Transcript:
You will hear a conversation between a university student and an administration officer about registering for a new lecture series.

First, you have some time to look at questions 1 to 5.

[Pause 30 seconds]

You will see that there is an example that has been done for you. On this occasion only, the conversation relating to this will be played first.

Administrator: Good morning, How may I help you?
Student: Good morning. I'm here to inquire about registering for the new 'Future Technologies' lecture series. My name is Jane Doe.

Her name is Jane Doe. So, 'Jane Doe' has been written in the space for the Student Name.

Now we shall begin. You should answer the questions as you listen because you will not hear the recording a second time. Listen carefully and answer questions 1 to 5.

Administrator: Good morning. How may I help you?
Student: Good morning. I'm here to inquire about registering for the new 'Future Technologies' lecture series. My name is Jane Doe.
Administrator: Ah, Miss Doe. Welcome. Do you have your student ID number handy?
Student: Yes, I do. It’s JDH-8546. I’m a second-year student.
Administrator: JDH-8546. Thank you. And could you confirm your primary course of study for me, please?
Student: Certainly. I'm studying Sociology. I know the lecture series sounds a bit outside my field, but I'm very interested in interdisciplinary topics.
Administrator: That's perfectly fine, Miss Doe. Many students from various departments attend. So, you're interested in the 'Future Technologies' series. Are you referring to the one specifically titled 'The Future of Robotics and Automation'? There's also one on 'Digital Ethics'.
Student: Yes, that's the one! 'The Future of Robotics and Automation'. I saw the poster near the main library. It looks fascinating.
Administrator: It is indeed a very popular series. It starts next week. Let me just check the schedule for you. Here we are. The first lecture for 'The Future of Robotics and Automation' is scheduled for Tuesday, not Monday as some students mistakenly think. It's an afternoon session.
Student: Great, Tuesday works perfectly for me. What time does it start, and which room is it in?
Administrator: It commences at 2 p.m. and will be held in Lecture Theatre 305. Not 205, so please make a note of that. We had some confusion last term. It's quite a large theatre, so you shouldn't have any trouble finding a seat.
Student: Excellent! Lecture Theatre 305, on Tuesday at 2 p.m. And how many lectures are there in the series in total?
Administrator: There are six lectures in total, held weekly, every Tuesday at the same time and in the same room. The full schedule is also available online, but I can print out a summary if you like.
Student: That would be very helpful, thank you. I just wanted to make sure I had the key details correct for the first one.
Administrator: No problem at all, Miss Doe. I’ll just get that summary printed for you. And do remember to sign in each week, as attendance contributes to a participation certificate at the end of the series.
Student: I will, thank you for your help.
Administrator: You're most welcome. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
Student: No, that's all for now. Thanks again.

You will hear a university staff member giving an orientation to new students about campus facilities. First, you have some time to look at questions 1 to 5.

[Pause 30 seconds]

Now listen carefully and answer questions 1 to 5.

Good morning everyone, and a very warm welcome to all our new students here at Westway University. My name is Dr. Eleanor Vance, and I'm the Head of Student Services. Today, I'll be guiding you through some of the key facilities on campus, helping you to find your way around and ensuring you know where to access essential resources. Please refer to the map in front of you as I speak. We'll be starting our tour from the Main Entrance, which you can see at the very bottom of your map.

As you enter the university grounds through the Main Entrance, you'll find the main road leading directly ahead. Our first point of interest, though not a labelled item on your map, is the Security Lodge, which is located immediately to your right, in Area A. It's marked clearly on the campus, and staff there are always available for assistance, especially outside of regular office hours. Moving on, let's locate some of the crucial services you'll need during your studies.

First, for all your academic material and general reading, the Bookshop is an essential stop. If you proceed past the Security Lodge, continuing straight along the main road, the Bookshop is located in Area C, on your right-hand side. It's a relatively large building, easily identifiable, and it stocks all required textbooks, stationery, and university merchandise. It also has a small café section, which is a popular spot for students to grab a quick coffee between lectures.

Next, you'll undoubtedly need to send or receive mail, so locating the Post Office is important. From our starting point at the Main Entrance, instead of turning right towards the Security Lodge or proceeding straight, look immediately to your left. You'll see a smaller building nestled just behind a cluster of trees. This is Area B, and it houses the campus Post Office, offering all standard postal services. It's quite convenient for students living on campus or those needing to send documents.

Now, let's continue further into the campus. As you walk along the main road, you'll pass the Bookshop on your right. Keep going straight, and you'll reach a large, imposing building directly in front of you, where the main road seems to momentarily end before branching off. This is the Central Auditorium, or the Main Lecture Theatre – a key landmark for orientation, located in Area E. This isn't one of the places you need to label, but it serves as an excellent reference point for the rest of our tour. Many of your large-group lectures will take place here.

From the Central Auditorium, if you turn right, you'll be on what we call East Avenue. The first building you encounter on your right as you walk down East Avenue is in Area F. This area is home to the Student Union Building, another vital hub for student life, where you'll find various clubs and societies. However, if you continue past the Student Union, further along East Avenue, the next building on your right-hand side is in Area G. This facility provides invaluable assistance for your future career aspirations – it is the Careers Service. They offer guidance on job applications, interview techniques, CV writing, and internship opportunities. It's highly recommended you visit them well before you graduate.

Returning to the Central Auditorium, if instead of turning right onto East Avenue, you turn left, you'll find yourself on West Avenue. The first building on your left along West Avenue is in Area F. Excuse me, I mean Area H. This is where the IT Support Centre is situated. This centre is vital for all your technical needs, whether it's setting up your university account, troubleshooting software issues, or accessing specialist computing facilities. They also run workshops on various software packages, which can be incredibly useful. So, that's the IT Support Centre in Area H.

And finally, for those of you interested in sports and fitness, let's locate the Sports Complex. Continuing along West Avenue, past the IT Support Centre in Area H, you'll come to a much larger facility at the very end of this road, taking up the entire Area I. This comprehensive facility includes a large gymnasium, a swimming pool, several indoor courts for basketball and badminton, and an outdoor athletics track. It's a fantastic resource for staying active and healthy during your time here. Remember, all registered students have access to these facilities.

We've covered the Bookshop, Post Office, Careers Service, IT Support Centre, and the Sports Complex. I hope this initial orientation has been helpful.

That is the end of Section 2. You now have half a minute to check your answers.

What TWO significant challenges does the lecturer identify regarding the widespread implementation of Open Educational Resources?

Transcript:
Examiner: You will hear a part of a university lecture about Open Educational Resources.

First, you have some time to look at questions...

(Pause for a few seconds)

Examiner: Now listen carefully and answer the questions.

Lecturer: Good morning, everyone. Today, we're going to delve into a topic that has significantly reshaped the landscape of higher education over the past two decades: Open Educational Resources, or OERs. The concept of OERs isn't entirely new, but its global impact and potential are still being fully realised. Essentially, OERs are teaching, learning, and research materials in any medium – digital or otherwise – that reside in the public domain or have been released under an open license that permits no-cost access, use, adaptation, and redistribution by others with no or limited restrictions.

The genesis of the modern OER movement can largely be traced back to MIT's OpenCourseWare initiative in 2001, which sought to make course materials for virtually all of MIT’s courses freely available on the web. This pioneering effort demonstrated the viability and demand for high-quality, openly licensed educational content. Since then, the movement has grown exponentially, supported by organisations like UNESCO and various foundations, leading to a vast ecosystem of open textbooks, lecture notes, multimedia presentations, entire courses, and even assessment tools.

So, what are the primary drivers and benefits behind this movement? Firstly, and perhaps most obviously, OERs address the escalating cost of traditional textbooks and educational materials, making higher education more accessible and affordable for students globally. This is particularly crucial in developing nations where access to up-to-date resources can be severely limited due to financial barriers. Secondly, OERs promote equity and inclusivity by breaking down geographical and socio-economic barriers to learning. Anyone with internet access can potentially learn from world-class institutions and educators, regardless of their location or financial status.

From an institutional perspective, OERs foster collaboration and innovation. Educators can share, adapt, and improve upon existing materials, rather than constantly reinventing the wheel. This can lead to more dynamic curricula, faster updates to content reflecting new research, and a reduction in the time and resources faculty spend on developing foundational teaching materials. Furthermore, the principles of open pedagogy, which often accompany OER adoption, encourage students to become co-creators of knowledge rather than mere consumers, leading to deeper engagement and learning outcomes.

However, despite these compelling advantages, the widespread implementation and sustainability of OERs are not without their significant challenges. One major hurdle is the perception and reality of quality assurance. While many OERs are peer-reviewed or developed by reputable institutions, there's a vast range in quality, and ensuring that materials are accurate, current, and pedagogically sound can be a complex and time-consuming task for individual educators. The sheer volume of available resources can also be overwhelming, making it difficult to sift through and identify the most appropriate and effective content for specific courses.

Another critical issue is the sustainability models for OER creation and maintenance. Unlike proprietary materials, which are funded through sales, OERs often rely on grants, institutional funding, or volunteer efforts. These funding sources can be inconsistent, leading to concerns about the long-term viability of some OER projects and the continuous updating of materials. Furthermore, while the materials themselves are free, the infrastructure and human resources required to curate, host, and provide technical support for OER initiatives at an institutional level still represent a significant investment. This includes the need for dedicated staff to manage platforms, provide faculty training on how to effectively integrate OERs into their teaching, and offer ongoing technical assistance to both educators and students.

Additionally, there's the challenge of digital literacy and access. While OERs aim to democratise education, their reliance on digital platforms can exclude individuals in areas with limited internet access or those lacking the necessary digital skills. Bridging this digital divide remains an ongoing concern. Finally, faculty adoption is a significant factor. Shifting from traditional textbooks to OERs often requires a change in pedagogical approach, and some educators may be resistant to this shift due to comfort with existing methods, lack of time for adaptation, or insufficient institutional support for making the transition.

In conclusion, while Open Educational Resources offer a transformative vision for global education, their journey towards universal adoption is paved with substantial considerations regarding quality control, financial sustainability, digital equity, and the need for robust institutional support and training. Addressing these challenges is paramount for OERs to truly fulfil their promise.
