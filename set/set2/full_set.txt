Transcript:
You will hear a conversation between Sarah, a new university student, and Dr. Evans, an academic advisor, discussing Sarah's lecture schedule for her first semester.
First, you have some time to look at questions 1 to 7.

(Pause 30 seconds)

Now listen carefully and answer questions 1 to 7.

Dr. Evans: Good morning, Sarah. Welcome to the university, and congratulations on securing your place here. Please have a seat.
Sarah: Thank you, Dr. Evans. It's really exciting to finally be here.
Dr. Evans: We're delighted to have you. So, you're here to go over your first-semester lecture schedule, just to iron out any final details and ensure you're all set, is that right?
Sarah: Yes, that's exactly right. I've got a printout here, but I just want to make sure I have all the details perfectly straight, especially regarding room numbers and any specific preparation.
Dr. Evans: Excellent. That's precisely what I'm here for. Let's start with your Monday lecture. You're enrolled in 'Introduction to Psychology,' aren't you?
Sarah: Yes, 'Introduction to Psychology.' That's my first lecture of the week.
Dr. Evans: Perfect. That particular module is taught by Dr. Harrison, and it's scheduled every Monday morning at 10:00 AM. The location for that is Lecture Hall 3, which is quite a large venue. The main focus throughout the term will be an overview of basic psychological concepts and theories, providing a solid foundation for your studies. For required preparation each week, you'll need to read Chapter 1 of the core course textbook. The full title of that book is 'Psychology: A Modern Approach'. So, 'Psychology: A Modern Approach' is the key text for that one. Make sure you get access to it early.
Sarah: Okay, so 'Psychology' for the title, and then for the reading, it's Chapter 1 of 'Psychology: A Modern Approach'. Got it. That sounds manageable.
Dr. Evans: Good. Now, moving on to Wednesday. You have 'Modern European History'.
Sarah: Is that lecture still with Dr. Patel? I really liked her introductory talk during orientation week.
Dr. Evans: Yes, that's absolutely correct. It is indeed Dr. Patel. It's held on Wednesdays, but please make a note as there's been a slight adjustment to the time recently. It used to be scheduled for 2 PM, but it's now officially set for 3 PM.
Sarah: Oh, 3 PM? Not two? I definitely had two written down in my provisional timetable. That's an important change.
Dr. Evans: Yes, a very recent update, so it's good we're clarifying this. It's 3 PM, and the lecture takes place in Arts Block 5. The lecture series will specifically focus on post-war developments in Europe, from 1945 onwards. For preparation, you should review the articles provided on the course website, rather than a specific textbook chapter. They'll be uploaded weekly.
Sarah: Okay, 3 PM, Arts Block 5. And just review the articles on the website. Thanks so much for clarifying that time change; I would have definitely shown up an hour early!
Dr. Evans: No problem at all, Sarah. It happens. Finally, your Friday lecture is 'Economics and Society'.
Sarah: Ah, I actually thought I had 'Politics and Society' down for Friday. Is that a different module entirely?
Dr. Evans: Yes, 'Politics and Society' is an entirely separate module. Your enrollment is for 'Economics and Society'. Professor Lee is the lecturer for that one. It's consistently at 11:00 AM, and you'll find it in Main Building, room 104.
Sarah: Main Building, room 104, got it. And what's the primary focus for 'Economics and Society'?
Dr. Evans: The key focus will be understanding the impact of various economic theories and policies on daily life, both locally and globally. And for your weekly preparation, Professor Lee strongly advises students to familiarize themselves with current economic news. You don't need to read a specific academic book for this, just stay updated with major current events and trends in the global economy.
Sarah: Current economic news. That sounds like a very practical and interesting approach.
Dr. Evans: Indeed. It certainly is. So, just to recap everything: 'Introduction to Psychology' on Monday, 'Modern European History' on Wednesday at 3 PM, and 'Economics and Society' on Friday. Does that all make perfect sense to you now?
Sarah: Yes, it does. All clear now. Thank you so much for your time and for going through everything, Dr. Evans. That's really helpful and puts my mind at ease.
Dr. Evans: You're very welcome, Sarah. My pleasure. Remember, the student support office is always there if you have any further questions throughout the term. Good luck with your studies!

MAN: You will hear a conversation between a student and a university academic support officer regarding registration for a guest lecture series.

First, you have some time to look at questions 1 to 4.

[Pause 30 seconds]

Now listen carefully and answer questions 1 to 4.

ADMINISTRATOR: Good morning, Academic Support Office, how can I help you today?
CLARA: Good morning. My name is Clara Smith, and I’m calling because I'd like to register for a special guest lecture series that was advertised recently.
ADMINISTRATOR: Of course, Clara. Happy to assist. Could you please confirm your full name for me, including the spelling of your surname?
CLARA: Yes, it's Clara Smith. That’s S-M-I-T-H.
ADMINISTRATOR: Thank you, Clara. And your student ID number, please?
CLARA: My student ID is 98765.
ADMINISTRATOR: Got it. 98765. And a contact number where we can reach you?
CLARA: Certainly. It's 07700 900505.
ADMINISTRATOR: Just to confirm, that's zero seven seven double zero, nine double zero, five oh five. Is that correct?
CLARA: Yes, that’s right.
ADMINISTRATOR: Excellent. And your university email address, please?
CLARA: It's clara.smith@uniwest.ac.uk. That’s U-N-I-W-E-S-T.

ADMINISTRATOR: Clara.smith@uniwest.ac.uk. Perfect.

Before you hear the rest of the conversation, you have some time to look at questions 5 to 10.

[Pause 30 seconds]

Now listen and answer questions 5 to 10.

ADMINISTRATOR: Now, regarding the lecture series, could you tell me its full title?
CLARA: Yes, it’s called "Innovations in Computer Science". I believe it's quite a prominent series.
ADMINISTRATOR: Ah, yes, "Innovations in Computer Science". We've had a lot of interest in that one. And the main speaker for the series is Professor Davies, isn't it?
CLARA: That's right, Professor Davies. I'm really looking forward to his insights.
ADMINISTRATOR: Good. Now, the series has several sessions. Which dates are you planning to attend?
CLARA: I’m definitely interested in the first two – Monday, 15th October, which is on AI Ethics, and Wednesday, 17th October, covering Data Privacy. But I also wanted to make sure I could attend the final one.
ADMINISTRATOR: The final session is on Friday, October 19th, on Future Trends, correct?
CLARA: Exactly! I don’t want to miss that one.
ADMINISTRATOR: So, that’s the 15th, 17th, and 19th of October. Noted. And for the Friday lecture, the one on Future Trends, it will be held in the Main Hall, in Room 204. Is that clear?
CLARA: Yes, Room 204. Got it.
ADMINISTRATOR: Lastly, do you have any special requirements for your attendance? For example, regarding access or materials?
CLARA: Yes, actually. I was hoping to get access to the lecture slides online at least 24 hours before each lecture, if possible. I find it really helps me prepare.
ADMINISTRATOR: That's a reasonable request. I'll make a note of that: access to slides 24 hours prior. And anything else?
CLARA: Hmm, just one more thing. I sometimes struggle to see the screen properly from the back, so could I request a seat near the front?
ADMINISTRATOR: Of course. We can certainly arrange for a seat near the front for you. So, that’s a seat near the front, access to slides 24 hours before, and attendance for the 15th, 17th, and 19th October sessions of "Innovations in Computer Science". Does that cover everything?
CLARA: Yes, that’s perfect. Thank you so much for your help!
ADMINISTRATOR: You're very welcome, Clara. We'll send a confirmation email to you shortly. Have a great day.
CLARA: You too, goodbye.

MALE SPEAKER: Good morning, everyone, and a very warm welcome to the Arts and Humanities building. My name is Dr. Eleanor Vance, and I am the Head of Student Services here at the university. Today, I'll be guiding you through a brief orientation of this building, focusing on key facilities you’ll frequently use during your studies, especially in relation to your upcoming lectures and seminars. Please take a moment to look at the map provided. You are currently positioned at the Main Entrance, marked A, of the building.

Before we proceed with the tour, let's take a quick look at the first set of questions, 1 to 6. You'll have a short moment to familiarise yourselves with them. Remember, we'll be identifying specific locations on the map as I describe them.

[Pause for 30 seconds]

Right, let's commence our tour. As I mentioned, we are starting at the Main Entrance, point A. As you step inside, you'll immediately notice a spacious lobby area directly in front of you. To your immediate right, you'll find space B, which currently houses a temporary exhibition showcasing postgraduate research projects. It's often used for various departmental displays throughout the year. And directly opposite, to your immediate left, is space C, which is our security office and lost property, open 24/7 for any urgent queries or to report lost items. Now, from this lobby, if you walk straight ahead, you will enter the main central corridor of the building.

Let's continue down this corridor. Approximately 20 metres from the lobby, on your right-hand side, you will come across a significant facility. This is our primary venue for large-group teaching and our most technologically advanced lecture space. I'm referring to **Lecture Theatre One**. It's equipped with state-of-the-art audiovisual systems and boasts seating for over 300 students. This will be where many of your core module lectures will take place. So, please mark **D** as **Lecture Theatre One**.

Directly opposite Lecture Theatre One, on your left, you'll find a highly popular student facility. This area, marked **E**, is designed as a comfortable, informal meeting space. It features soft seating, charging points for devices, and tables for group discussions or simply relaxing between classes. It's known as the **Student Common Room**. It's an excellent place to socialise, collaborate on projects, or grab a quick break. So, **E** is the **Student Common Room**.

Moving further down the corridor, past the central stairwell on your left, you'll reach another crucial resource for your academic work. On your right-hand side, you'll see a dedicated area, marked **F**, housing numerous workstations running specialist software essential for many of your courses, particularly in digital humanities and research methods. This is our main **Computer Suite**, accessible with your student ID card during building hours. We have technical support staff available here during peak times to assist with any software or hardware queries. Therefore, **F** corresponds to the **Computer Suite**.

Opposite the Computer Suite, on your left, you'll discover a vital support service. This space, indicated by **G**, provides one-on-one consultation with experienced staff members who can offer guidance on academic progress, personal welfare, and university regulations. Appointments are recommended but drop-in sessions are often available. This is the **Student Advisor's Office**. They are an invaluable resource for navigating university life. So, **G** should be marked as the **Student Advisor's Office**.

Continuing to the very end of the corridor, just before the emergency exit, you'll find two more important locations. To your right, you'll encounter a vibrant hub, marked **H**, where you can purchase a variety of refreshments, light meals, and snacks. It's a busy spot, especially around lunchtime, offering a great selection of hot and cold beverages. This is our **Main Café**, a central spot for quick breaks and informal meetings. So, **H** is the **Main Café**.

And finally, to your left, at the very end of the corridor, in space **I**, you'll find a quieter, more focused study environment. This area is specifically designated for students undertaking advanced research and thesis writing. It provides individual desks, access to specialised journals, and a conducive atmosphere for intensive academic work. This is the **Postgraduate Study Area**. While primarily for postgraduates, it does offer a glimpse into the advanced academic life here. So, **I** is the **Postgraduate Study Area**.

That concludes our brief introductory tour of the key facilities on the ground floor of the Arts and Humanities building. I hope this orientation has been helpful in familiarising you with your new academic environment. Should you have any questions, please feel free to approach me or any of the student ambassadors present today. Thank you for your attention.

## IELTS Listening Test: Section 3

You will hear a discussion between Dr. Eleanor Vance, a university lecturer, and two students, Liam and Chloe, about preparing for their final academic presentations.

First, you have some time to look at questions 1 to 6.

[silence 30 seconds]

Now listen carefully and answer questions 1 to 6.

**Dr. Vance:** Good morning, Liam, Chloe. Thanks for coming in. As you know, your final academic presentations are fast approaching, and I wanted to use this session to discuss the process of preparing a truly effective presentation. We'll go through the key stages, and I'm keen to hear your thoughts and address any concerns.

**Liam:** Thanks, Dr. Vance. I've already started thinking about my topic, which is 'The Socio-Economic Impact of Urban Green Spaces'. I'm trying to narrow it down to a manageable scope.

**Chloe:** And I'm doing mine on 'The Evolution of Digital Privacy Legislation'. It's a vast subject, so I'm finding the initial research quite overwhelming.

**Dr. Vance:** Excellent topics, both. Let's start with 'Developing Content', which is crucial. Chloe, you mentioned finding research overwhelming. What steps are you taking to manage that?

**Chloe:** Well, I'm trying to identify key journals and authoritative books, but there's just so much information. I'm worried about missing crucial arguments.

**Liam:** I agree. It's not just about quantity, is it? It's about quality. I've been spending a lot of time cross-referencing sources and checking the methodological soundness of studies before I even consider them for my presentation.

**Dr. Vance:** Precisely, Liam. Before you even start synthesizing information, the foundational step is always researching credible sources thoroughly. Without that, your arguments lack weight. Don't just skim; interrogate your sources. Now, moving on to 'Structuring the Narrative'. You've got your content, how do you plan to present it? Liam, you go first.

**Liam:** I'm aiming for a logical flow: introduction, then three main points, each supported by evidence, and finally a conclusion. I think the intro needs to hook the audience, and the main body needs to be clear and persuasive.

**Chloe:** I'm planning something similar. I'm focusing on signposting – making it clear where I am in the presentation at all times. But I'm always a bit stumped by the conclusion. It feels like a summary, but I know it needs to be more than that.

**Dr. Vance:** You're right, Chloe. A conclusion isn't merely a recap. While it should certainly summarize your core findings, an effective academic presentation requires crafting a memorable conclusion that leaves the audience with a lasting impression or a clear takeaway message. Perhaps a call to action, or a thought-provoking final statement related to the broader implications of your research. It shouldn't just fizzle out. What about 'Creating Visual Support'? Slides are indispensable, but often misused. What are your strategies here?

**Chloe:** I'm using PowerPoint, keeping text minimal and using bullet points. I want to incorporate a few key graphs and charts to illustrate data.

**Liam:** I'm thinking about including short video clips or animations for my topic, especially when discussing urban development. I think it adds another dimension and can be really engaging, if done well.

**Dr. Vance:** Excellent point, Liam. Beyond static images and text, integrating multimedia elements such as short, relevant videos, interactive maps, or even audio clips can significantly enhance audience engagement and understanding, particularly for complex concepts. Just ensure they complement, rather than distract from, your message. Now, 'Rehearsing Delivery' is vital. Most students practice their timing, but what else should you focus on?

**Liam:** I usually practice my tone of voice and eye contact. I find rehearsing in front of a mirror helps with body language.

**Chloe:** I try to anticipate where I might stumble over words or complex phrases. And I sometimes record myself to hear how I sound.

**Dr. Vance:** All good strategies. And what about 'Preparing for Interaction'? The Q&A session can often be the most challenging part. How do you plan to approach it?

**Chloe:** I'm expecting questions about my methodology and the practical implications of new legislation. I'm trying to think of answers in advance.

**Liam:** I'm anticipating pushback on some of my proposals for urban planning. I guess I'll just have to be ready to defend my points.

**Dr. Vance:** That's the right mindset. It's not enough to just anticipate questions; you need to be prepared with solid, evidence-based responses. The most successful presenters dedicate time to preparing succinct answers to anticipated queries. Don't ramble; be precise and refer back to your research. Lastly, 'Refinement and Feedback'. Recording yourself is excellent for self-critique, Chloe, but what other avenues for feedback should you explore?

**Liam:** I've asked a few classmates to listen to my practice run and give me their thoughts.

**Chloe:** Me too. My study group is really helpful for pointing out areas that aren't clear.

**Dr. Vance:** Peer feedback is valuable, certainly. But to truly refine your approach and ensure your presentation resonates with a broader audience, it's highly beneficial to consider seeking feedback from diverse perspectives. This could mean asking someone from a different discipline, or even a friend who's not an academic. They might spot assumptions or jargon that an expert wouldn't. Their fresh eyes can be invaluable. Finally, 'Final Polish'. What does that entail for you, just before the big day?

**Liam:** A thorough proofread of my slides, checking for typos and consistent formatting. And making sure my notes are easy to follow.

**Chloe:** I'll check the overall coherence – does everything flow logically? Does my argument build effectively from start to finish?

**Dr. Vance:** Both are vital. And don't forget the overarching message. At this final stage, it's critical to ensure you are summarizing core arguments effectively. You want your audience to walk away remembering your main points clearly and concisely, not just a jumble of facts. Your presentation should be a distillation of your research, not merely a recitation. Alright, we've covered a lot. Any immediate questions about these stages?
