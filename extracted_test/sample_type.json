Can I help you? \nB Oh yes, I’m ringing to make enquiries about sending a large box, a container, \nback home to Kenya from the UK. \nA Yes, of course. Would you like me to try and find some quotations for you? \nB Yes, that’d be great. Thank you. \nA Well first of all, I need a few details from you. \nB Fine. \nA Can I take your name? \nB It’s Jacob Mkere. \nA Can you spell your surname, please? \nB Yes, it’s M-K-E-R-E. \nA Is that ‘M’ for mother? \nB Yes. \nA Thank you, and you say that you will be sending the box to Kenya? \nB That’s right. \nA And where would you like the box picked up from? \nB From college, if possible. \nA Yes, of course. I’ll take down the address now. \nB It’s Westall College. \nA Is that W-E-S-T-A-L-L? \nB Yes, ... college. \nA Westall College. And where’s that? \nB It’s Downlands Road, in Bristol. \nA Oh yes, I know it. And the postcode? \nB It’s BS8 9PU. \nA Right ... and I need to know the size. \nB Yes, I’ve measured it carefully and it’s 1.5m long ... \nA Right. \nB 0.75m wide ... \nA OK. \nB And it’s 0.5m high or deep. \nA Great. So I’ll calculate the volume in a moment and get some quotes for that. \nBut first can you tell me, you know, very generally, what will be in the box? \nB Yes there’s mostly clothes. \nA OK. [writing down] \nB And there’s some books. \nA OK. Good. Um ... Anything else? \nB Yes, there’s also some toys. \nA OK and what is the total value, do you think, of the contents? \nB Well the main costs are the clothes and the books – they’ll be about £1500 but \nthen the toys are about another two hundred – so I’d put down £1700."

There’s really three rates according to quality of insurance cover \n– there’s the highest comprehensive cover which is Premium rate, then there’s \nStandard rate and then there’s Economy rate. That one will only cover the cost \nof the contents second hand. \nB Oh I’ve been stung before with Economy insurance so I’ll go for the highest. \nA Mh’hm and can I just check would you want home delivery or to a local depot or \nwould you want to pick it up at the nearest port? \nB The port’d be fine – I’ve got transport that end."

    "Transcript": "Good evening, and welcome to the British Council. My name is John Parker and I’ve \nbeen asked to talk to you briefly about certain aspects of life in the UK before you \nactually go there. So I'm going to talk first about the best ways of making social \ncontacts there. Now you might be wondering why it should be necessary. After all, \nwe meet people all the time. But when you’re living in a foreign country it can be \nmore difficult, not just because of the language, but because customs may be \ndifferent. \n\nIf you’re going to work in the UK you will probably be living in private \naccommodation, so it won’t be quite so easy to meet people. But there are still things \nthat you can do to help yourself. First of all, you can get involved in activities in your \nlocal community, join a group of some kind. For example, you’ll probably find that \nthere are theatre groups who might be looking for actors, set designers and so on, or \nif you play an instrument you could join music groups in your area. Or if you like the \nidea of finding out about local history there’ll be a group for that too. These are just \nexamples. And the best places to get information about things like this are either the \ntown hall or the public library. Libraries in the UK perform quite a broad range of \nfunctions nowadays – they’re not just confined to lending books, although that’s their \nmain role of course."

    "Transcript": "Paul \nThe other thing I wanted to ask you was, did you find it hard, studying \nwith the Open University? \nRachel You mean, because you’re studying on your own, most of the time? \nPaul \nMm. \nRachel Well it took me a while to get used to it. I found I needed to maintain a \nhigh level of motivation, because it’s so different from school. There’s no-\none saying, ‘Why haven’t you written your assignment yet?' and that sort \nof thing. \nPaul \nOh dear. \nRachel You’ll learn it, Paul. Another thing was that I got very good at time- \nmanagement because I had to fit time for studying round a full-time job. \nPaul \nWell I’m hoping to change to working part-time, so that’ll help. \nRachel What makes it easier is that the degree is made up of modules, so you can \ntake time off between them if you need to. It isn’t like a traditional three-\nor four-year course, where you’ve got to do the whole thing of it in one go. \nPaul \nThat’s good, because I’d like to spend six months travelling next year. \nRachel Huh, it’s all right for some. Then even though you’re mostly studying at \nhome, remember you’ve got tutors to help you, and from time to time \nthere are summer schools. They usually last a week. They’re great, \nbecause you meet all the other people struggling with the same things as \nyou."

    "Transcript": "Dr Ray \nCome in. Oh hello Jack. Have a seat. Right ... you said you wanted to see \nme to talk about your options next semester? \nJack \nThat's right. We have to decide by the end of next week. Really, I'd like to \ndo all five options but we have to choose two, don't we. \nDr Ray \nYes, but the choice depends on your major to some extent. You're \nmajoring in Communication Studies, aren't you? \nJack \nThat's right. \nDr Ray \nSo for example the Media Studies Option will cover quite a lot of the \nsame area you did in the core module on mass communications this \nsemester - the development of the media through the last two centuries, \nin relation to political and social issues. \nJack \nMmm. Well that was interesting, but I’ve decided I'd rather do something \ncompletely new. There's a Women's Studies option, isn't there? \nDr Ray \nYes, 'Women and Power' – again it has a historical focus, it aims to \ncontextualise women's studies by looking at the legal and social situation \nin the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries … \nJack \nSo it would be useful if I intended to specialise in women's studies ... but \nI'm not sure I do actually. \nDr Ray \nWell, it might still be useful to give you an idea of the issues involved. It's \ntaught by Dr Steed. \nJack \nOh, really? I'll sign up for that, then. What about the option on Culture \nand Society? \nDr Ray \nThat addresses the historical debate on the place of culture since the \nIndustrial Revolution in Britain. \nJack \nSo a historical focus again ... \nDr Ray \nDo I get the message you're not so keen on history? \nJack \nWell, it's just we seem to have done quite a lot this semester … anyway \nI'll think about that one. \nDr Ray \nIf you're interested in a course focusing on current issues there's the \noption on Identity and Popular Culture – that approaches the subject \nthrough things like contemporary film, adverts, soap operas and so on. \nJack \nOh? That sounds interesting. Can you tell me who runs it? \nDr Ray \nWell, it's normally Dr Stevens but he's on sabbatical next semester, so \nI'm not sure who'll be running it. It should be decided by next week \nthough. \nJack \nRight, well I might wait until then to decide ... And the last option is \nIntroduction to Cultural Theory, isn't it. I'm quite interested in that too – I \nwas talking to one of the second year students, and she said it was really \nuseful, it made a lot of things fall into place. \nDr Ray \nYes, but in fact in your major, you'll have covered a lot of that already in \nCommunications 102, so that might be less useful than some of the \nothers. \nJack \nOh, I'll forget about that one, then."

Can you tell me something about the possibilities? \nOfficial OK, right, well there are five hotels that might interest you. Were you \nwanting a city centre location, or would you be interested in something a \nbit further out? \nMan \nWell, I do have a car so I could go for either. \nOfficial Well, there are two central hotels in the range you're looking for – there's \nCarlton House and The Imperial, they're both near the main square, but if \nyou've got your own transport you might be interested in the Royal Oak – \nthat’s out in the country, about ten kilometres away, very peaceful. Then \nthere's the Bridge hotel and the Majestic – they're both in town but not in \nthe centre, they're out on the airport road. \nMan \nMmm that might be a bit far out actually. OK, now the other two you \nmentioned, in the city centre. Can you tell me a bit about them? \nOfficial Well, they're both excellent hotels. If you want something with a bit of \ncharacter, Carlton House is quite unusual – it's a very old building that \nwas originally a large private house. It was bought by the Vannis chain \nand they completely refurbished it – they took their first guests just a few \nmonths ago but it's already got an excellent reputation. That's a five-star \nhotel. Or there's the Imperial, which is a much more modern building. \nThat also has its own gym and it also has internet connection and \nmeetings rooms – it's used for conferences and corporate events as well \nas private guests. That's five-star as well. \nMan \nDoes it have a swimming pool as well as a gym? \nOfficial No – the Royal Oak has an outdoor pool, which is lovely in the summer, \nbut the only hotel with an indoor pool is the Bridge Hotel. It doesn't have \na gym though. The Majestic is planning to build a swimming pool and a \nfitness centre, but it's not finished yet."

My name is Ann, \nand I'm the chief librarian here, and you'll usually find me at the desk just by the \nmain entrance here. So I'd like to tell you a bit about the way the library is organised, \nand what you'll find where … and you should all have a plan in front of you. Well, as \nyou see my desk is just on your right as you go in, and opposite this the first room on \nyour left has an excellent collection of reference books and is also a place where \npeople can read or study peacefully. Just beyond the librarian's desk on the right is a \nroom where we have up to date periodicals such as newspapers and magazines and \nthis room also has a photocopier in case you want to copy any of the articles. If you \ncarry straight on you'll come into a large room and this is the main library area. There \nis fiction in the shelves on the left, and non-fiction materials on your right, and on the \nshelves on the far wall there is an excellent collection of books relating to local \nhistory. We're hoping to add a section on local tourist attractions too, later in the \nyear. Through the far door in the library just past the fiction shelves is a seminar \nroom, and that can be booked for meetings or talks, and next door to that is the \nchildren's library, which has a good collection of stories and picture books for the \nunder elevens. Then there's a large room to the right of the library area – that's the \nmultimedia collection, where you can borrow videos and DVDs and so on, and we \nalso have CD-Roms you can borrow to use on your computer at home. It was \noriginally the art collection but that's been moved to another building. And that's \nabout it – oh, there's also the Library Office, on the left of the librarian's desk. OK, \nnow does anyone have any questions?"

    "Transcript": "Hello, and welcome to “Focus on the Arts”. I’m your host - Dave Green - and this is \nyour very own local radio programme. Every Friday evening we put the spotlight on \ndifferent arts and culture facilities, and look at the shows and events that are on offer \nin the coming week. \n\nAnd today the focus is on The National Arts Centre. Now, if you don’t already know it \nyourself, I’m sure you’ve all heard of it. It’s famous throughout the world as one of \nthe major venues for classical music. \n\nBut did you know that it’s actually much more than just a place to hear concerts? The \nCentre itself is a huge complex that caters for a great range of arts. Under a single \nroof it houses concert rooms, theatres, cinemas, art galleries and a wonderful public \nlibrary, as well as service facilities including 3 restaurants and a book shop. So, at any \none time, the choice of entertainment there is simply enormous. \n\nSo, how did they manage to build such a big arts complex right in the heart of the \ncity? Well, the area was completely destroyed by bombs during the war in 1940. So, \nthe opportunity was taken to create a cultural centre that would be, what they called: \n‘the City’s gift to the Nation’. Of course, it took a while for such a big project to get \nstarted, but it was planned in the 60s, built in the 70s and eventually opened to the \npublic in 1983. Ever since then it has proved to be a great success. It’s not privately \nowned, like many arts centres, but is still in public hands: - it’s run by the City Council. \nBoth our National Symphony Orchestra and National Theatre Company were \ninvolved in the planning of the project, and they are now based there - giving regular \nperformances every week - and as the Centre is open 363 days of the year, there are \nplenty of performances to choose from. \n\nPause \n\nSo, to give you some idea of what’s on, and to help you choose from the many \npossibilities, we’ve made a selection of the star attractions. \n\nIf you’re interested in classical music, then we recommend you go along to the \nNational on either Monday or Tuesday evening at 7.30 for a spectacular production \nof ‘The Magic Flute’ - probably the most popular of all Mozart’s operas. It’s in the \nGarden Hall and tickets start at only £8.00, but you’ll have to be early if you want to \nget them that cheap! And remember, it’s only on for those two evenings. \n\nFor those more interested in the cinema, you might like to see the new Canadian film \nwhich is showing on Wednesday evening at 8pm in Cinema 2. And that’s called ‘Three \nLives.’ It’s had fantastic reviews and tickets cost just £4.50, which is a reduction on the \nusual price of £5.50. So it’s really good value, especially for such a great movie. \n\nBut you can see the centre’s main attraction at the weekend, because on Saturday \nand Sunday, 11am to 10pm, they’re showing a wonderful new exhibition that hasn’t \nbeen seen anywhere else in Europe yet. It’s a collection of Chinese Art called ‘Faces of \nChina’ - that’s in Gallery 1 - and it has some really fascinating paintings and \nsculptures by leading artists from all over China - and the good news is that it’s \ncompletely free, so don’t miss it!"
