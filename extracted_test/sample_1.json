How can I help you?\nMan: Oh, hello - I'd like to order some stationery, please.\nWoman: And who am I speaking to?\nMan: John Carter.\nWoman: Right - can I just confirm your account number and the name of your company, John?\nMan: Sure! The account number is 6-9-2-4 double 1 [1]\nWoman: Six nine two four one one. Right, and you're from 'Rainbow Computers?'\nMan: No. The company is Rainbow Communications [2].\nWoman: Oh, OK, I'll just fix that on the system communications. And what would you like to order, John?\nMan: Envelopes. We need a box of A4 - that is, normal size envelopes.\nWoman: White, yellow or vanilla?\nMan: We'll have the plain white please [3] - but the ones with the little windows.\nWoman: OK. One box - A4 - white - just the one box, was it?\nMan: Uhm, on second thoughts make that two boxes [4]. We go through heaps of envelopes. As a matter of interest. Are \nthey made from recycled paper?\nWoman: No. You can't get white recycled paper. The recycled ones are grey and they're more expensive actually.\nMan: Right - we'll stick to white then.\nWoman: Something else, John?\nMan: Yes, we need some coloured photocopy paper. What colours do you have?\nWoman: We've got purple, light blue, blue, light green - whatever you want, pretty much. There are 500 sheets to the \npack.\nMan: Let's see... we're going to need a lot of blue paper for our new price lists so can you give us ten packs [6], please. \nMake sure it's the light blue though [5].\nWoman: Ten packs of the light blue. Anything else that we can help you with?\nMan: Let me think, what else do we need? I'm sure there was something else.\nWoman: Pens, paper clips, fax paper, computer supplies, office furniture?\nMan: Oh, yes! We need floppy disks [7] - do you have those nice coloured ones?\nWoman: Yes, but they're a bit more expensive than the black ones.\nMan: That's alright. I'm not paying, anyway!\nWoman: Right. Floppy disks. And what about diaries for next year? We've got them in stock already and it's a good idea \nto order early.\nMan: No — I think we're alright for diaries but something we do need is one of those big wall calendars — you know, \none that shows the whole year at a glance. Do you stock those?\nWoman: We certainly do.\nMan: OK - can you include a wall calendar then [8], with the other stuff. Just make sure it's got the whole year on the \none side.\nWoman: Sure - and do you have a copy of our new catalogue ?\nMan: No, I don't, but could you send one [9]?\nWoman: Yes! I'll pop one in with the order. You'll find it a lot easier to remember what you need if you have our \ncatalogue in front of you next time.\nMan: Yes, good idea. And when can you deliver this?\nWoman: Should be with you tomorrow morning.\nMan: Can you make sure that it's not after 11:30 AM [10] because I have to go out at 12 there's only myself here on \nFridays.\nWoman: Fine - I'll make a note on the delivery docket that they should deliver before half past eleven [10]. Thanks very \nmuch.\nMan: Thanks.",

    "Transcript": "Announcer: And now for some information on local events and activities. A couple of announcements for art-lovers and \nbudding artists alike. First, a new collection of artwork is going on show to the public next month in the form of an \nartists' exhibition. The exhibition will include many different types of art, over 100 different pieces, by 58 artists from the\nlocal area. It's being held at the Royal Museum [11] which - for those of you who are unfamiliar with the area - is located\nopposite the library in West Street, right on the corner. The actual address is number 1, Queen's Park Road [12] - it isn't \ndifficult to find. The exhibition will run for 9 weeks and will begin on the 6th of October and continue until the 10th \nDecember [13]. So there's plenty of time for you to go along and have a look and I'm sure that will be worth doing.\nWhat will you see there? Well, amongst the items on display will be some exciting pieces of modern jewellery, furniture, \nceramics, metal work [14] and sculpture. To give you some examples, local artist Kate Maine will be there to discuss her \ncollection of pots and bowls that she has made to resemble garden vegetables. They're the sort of thing that would \nbrighten up any dining table, and range from things like yellow cabbage-shaped bowls to round tomato- \n\n shaped teapots \n \n  \n[15 - note that the word 'vegetable' is not mentioned, but cabbage and tomato are both vegetables]. Prize-winner \nCynthia Course will also be there to talk about her silver jewellery, all of which she produced using ideas from the rural \nsetting of her country home. Some of her rings are quite extraordinary and have beautiful coloured stones [16] in them. \nOr if you prefer sculpture, there's plenty of that too. Take, for example, Susan Cup's sculpture of 25 pairs of white paper \nshoes [17]. It sounds easy, but believe me it looks incredible! All of these items along with many others will be on sale-throughout the exhibition period.\nAs part of the exhibition, there will be a series of demonstrations called 'Face to Face' [18 — remember to capitalise \nthe answer — it is a name of an exhibition] which will take place every Sunday afternoon during the exhibition and \nthese will provide an opportunity for you to meet the artists.\nThe second set of activities are for those who would prefer to indulge in some artwork themselves, the Artist's \nConservatory are holding a series of courses over the autumn period. The courses cover all media and include subjects \nsuch as Chinese brush painting, pencil drawing [19] and silk painting. All the tutors are experienced artists, course sizes \nare kept to a minimum of 15 and there will be plenty of individual assistance.\nAll the sessions offer excellent value for money and the opportunity to relax in a delightful rural setting. Fees are very \nreasonable and include the use of an excellent studio and access to the art shop which you will find sells everything from \npaper to CDs and they also include the provision of all materials [20]. For more information on dates, cost and \navailability you should get in touch with the programme coordinator on 4592 839584 or go direct to the website...",

    "Transcript": "Interviewer: Alison Sharp has spent much of her life researching bears and in particular bears in danger of extinction. \nShe is the author of a recent book on bears and we welcome her to the studio today.\nAlison: Thank you. Delighted to be here.\nInterviewer: First of all, can you give us a quick overview of the history of the bear family?\nAlison: Well, the bears we know today actually have as their ancestors bears which have been evolving for some 40 \nmillion years [21]. We have fossils of the earliest 'true bear' — and it's important to emphasise this because some \ncreatures are called bears but are not.\nInterviewer: Such as koalas for instance.\nAlison: Yes — exactly. Fossils of the true bear show a small dog-size animal with characteristics that show a blending of \ndog and bear traits.\nInterviewer: So the general belief is that dogs and bears were of the same family? [22]\nAlison: Yes, that's the theory [22]. And then we see the arrival of the early Cave Bear. We know from cave drawings that \nNeanderthal man used to worship this bear and at the same time fear it.\nInterviewer: Understandable perhaps.\nAlison: Yes, but they need not have worried because the Cave Bear only ate plants [23]. In fact the Cave Bear survived \ntwo Ice Ages but then became extinct.\nInterviewer: So how many bears can we find today and are any of them in danger of extinction?\nAlison: Well I'll answer your first question first. There are eight species of bear in all; among them the American Black \nBear and the Brown Bear — from which evolved the newest species of bear - the Polar Bear.\nInterviewer: So how old is the Polar Bear [24]?\nAlison: Oh, he's a relative newcomer - just 20,000 years old [24].\nInterviewer: And could you tell us a little about them? Which is the largest bear, for instance ?\nAlison: Well, the largest bear existing today is either the Polar Bear or the Brown Bear.\nInterviewer: Right! Don't we know?\nAlison: Well, it depends which criteria you use. The Polar Bear is the heaviest; the male weighs up to 1,500 pounds but \nhis narrow body actually makes him look smaller than the much more robust Brown Bear.\nInterviewer: So the Brown Bear appears the biggest [25].\nAlison: Yes [25].\nInterviewer: And the smallest?\nAlison: Well, the Sun Bear is the smallest of the eight species [26]. They only weigh between 60 and 145 pounds.\nInterviewer: That makes him a comparative junior!\nAlison: Yes. And then next we have the so-called Giant Panda, but that's a small bear too, comparatively speaking.\nInterviewer: And are all bears meat eaters?\nAlison: No, not at all. In fact the Giant Panda is almost entirely herbivorous living on a diet of 30 types of bamboo [27].\nInterviewer: Oh, yes of course. Panda's are famous for that.\nAlison: And another interesting bear is the Sloth Bear which eats insects [28], particularly termites. He can turn his \nmouth into a tube and suck the insects out of their nests.\nInterviewer: So going back to my second question... are bears really in danger of extinction?\nAlison: Yes indeed, they are — the Sun Bear in particular as they've been hunted almost out of existence. And the habitat\nof the Panda is also being reduced on a daily basis.\nInterviewer: Can anything be done to reduce the threat to these endangered species? I know for instance that it's very \nhard to breed bears in captivity.\nAlison: Yes, well, I think that by raising people's awareness generally we can reduce conflict between humans and \nanimals, to stop the slaughter in parts of the world where bears are still hunted [29] — supposedly in self-defense or to \nprotect livestock, but often quite unnecessarily. And we can also encourage governments to preserve the natural \nenvironment of the bear rather than allow the areas where they live to be systematically destroyed in the name of \nprogress.\nInterviewer: Yes, of course.\nAlison: And in addition to these global efforts, all profits from the sale of my book will go towards the United Nations \nBear Protection program [30].",

    "Transcript": "Man: Good evening and welcome to this month's Observatory Club lecture. I'm Donald Mackie and I'm here to talk to \nyou about the solar eclipse in history.\nA thousand years ago, a total eclipse of the sun was a terrifying religious experience - but these days an eclipse is more \nlikely to be viewed as a tourist attraction [31] than as a scientific or spiritual event. People will travel literally miles to be\nin the right place at the right time — to get the best view of their eclipse.\nWell. What exactly causes a solar eclipse — when the world goes dark for a few minutes in the middle of the day? \nScientifically speaking, the dark spot itself is easy to explain [32]: it is the shadow of the moon streaking across the earth.\nThis happens every year or two, each time along a different and, to all intents and purposes, a seemingly random piece of\nthe globe.\nIn the past people often interpreted an eclipse as a danger signal heralding disaster and in fact, the Chinese were so \ndisturbed by these events that they included among their gods one whose job it was to prevent eclipses [33]. But whether \nor not you are superstitious or take a purely scientific view, our earthly eclipses are special in three ways.\nFirstly, there can be no doubt that they are very beautiful. It's as if a deep blue curtain had fallen over the daytime sky as \nthe sun becomes a black void surrounded by the glow of its outer atmosphere.\nBut beyond this, total eclipses possess a second more compelling beauty in the eves of us scientists, for they offer a \nunique opportunity for research [34]. Only during an eclipse can we study the corona and other dim things that are \nnormally lost in the sun's glare.\nAnd thirdly, they are rare. Even though an eclipse of the sun occurs somewhere on earth every year or two, if you sit in \nyour garden and wait, it will take 375 years on average for one to come to you. If the moon were any larger, eclipses \nwould become a monthly bore [35]: if it were smaller, they simply would not be possible.\nThe ancient Babylonian priests, who spent a fair bit of time staring at the sky, had already noted that there was an 18-year\npattern in their recurrence but they didn't have the mathematics to predict an eclipse accurately [36]. It was Edmund \nHalley, the English astronomer, who knew his maths well enough to predict the return of the comet which, incidentally \nbears his name, and in 1715 he became the first person to make an accurate eclipse prediction [37].\nThis brought eclipses firmly into the scientific domain and they have since allowed a number of important scientific \ndiscoveries to be made. For instance, in the eclipse of 1868 two scientists, Janssen and Lockyer, were observing the sun's\natmosphere and it was these observations that ultimately led to the discovery of a new element [38]. They named the \nelement helium after the Greek god of the sun. This was a major find, because helium turned out to be the most common \nelement in the universe after hydrogen. Another great triumph involved Mercury. I'll just put that up on the board for you \nnow. See — there's Mercury — the planet closest to the Sun - then Venus, Earth, etc. For centuries, scientists had been \nunable to understand why Mercury appeared to rotate faster than it should. Some astronomers suggested that there might \nbe an undiscovered planet causing this unusual orbit and even gave it the name 'Vulcan'. During the eclipse of 1878, an \nAmerican astronomer, James Watson, thought he had spotted this so-called 'lost' planet [39]. But, alas for him, he was \nlater obliged to admit that he had been wrong about Vulcan and withdrew his claim.\nThen Albert Einstein came on the scene. Einstein suggested that rather than being wrong about the number of planets, \nastronomers were actually wrong about gravity [40]. Einstein's theory of relativity - for which he is so famous - \ndisagreed with Newton's law of gravity in just the right way to explain Mercury's odd orbit. He also realised that a \ndefinitive test would be possible during the total eclipse of 1919 and this is indeed when his theory was finally proved \ncorrect.",
