    "Transcript": "Jamie: Good morning. World Tours. My name is Jamie. How can I help you?\nAndrea: Good morning. I want some information on self-drive tours in the USA. Could you send me a brochure?\nJamie: Of course. Could I have your name please?\nAndrea: Andrea Brown.\nJamie: Thank you. And your address?\nAndrea: 24, Ardleigh Road [1].\nJamie: Can you spell that?\nAndrea: A-R-D-L-E-l-G-H Road [1].\nJamie: Postcode?\nAndrea: BH520P\nJamie: Thanks. And can I have your phone number?\nAndrea: Is a mobile alright?\nJamie: Fine.\nAndrea: It's 07786643091.\nJamie: Thank you. And can I ask you where you heard about World Tours? From a friend? Or did you see an advert \nsomewhere?\nAndrea: No. I read about you in the newspaper [2].\nJamie: OK, I'll get the brochures in the post to you but can I give you some information over the phone. What kinds of \nthings do you want to do on your holiday?\nAndrea: I’m interested in going to California with my family. I’ve got two children and we want to hire a car.\nJamie: OK. We have a couple of self-drive tours there visiting different places of interest in California. The first one \nbegins in Los Angeles and there's plenty of time to visit some of the theme parks there [3].\nAndrea: That’s something on my children’s list so I'd want to include that.\nJamie: Good. Then you drive to San Francisco. From San Francisco you can drive to Yosemite Park where you spend a \ncouple of nights. You can choose to stay in a lodge or on the campsite.\nAndrea: I don't like the idea of staying in a tent . It'd be too hot [4].\nJamie: Right. And the tour ends in Las Vegas.\nAndrea: OK.\nJamie: The other trip we can arrange is slightly different. It starts in San Francisco. Then you drive south to Cambria.\nAndrea: Someone told me there’s a really nice castle near Cambria [5]. Will we go near that?\nJamie: Hearst Castle is on that road so you could stop there.\nAndrea: Good. I'd like to do that. Does this trip also go into the desert?\nJamie: No, it continues to Santa Monica where most people like to stop and do some shopping.\nAndrea: We have enough of that at home so that doesn’t interest us.\nJamie: Well you could go straight on to San Diego [6].\nAndrea: That's good for beaches isn’t it? [6]\nJamie: That’s right, that's a good place to relax and your children might like to visit the zoo before flying home.\nAndrea: I don’t think so. We want some time for sunbathing and swimming. So how many days are the trips and how \nmuch do they cost?\nJamie: The first one I told you about is a self-drive tour through California which lasts twelve days and covers 2.020 \nkilometres [7]. The shortest journey is 206 km and the longest is 632 kilometres. The cost is ?525 per person. That \nincludes accommodation, car rental and a flight [8] but no meals.\nAndrea: And the other trip?\nJamie: That lasts nine days but you spend only three days on the road. You cover about 980 kilometres altogether.\nAndrea: So is that cheaper then?\nJamie: Yes, it's almost a hundred pounds cheaper. It’s ?429 per person [9], which is a good deal.\nAndrea: So that covers accommodation and car hire. What about flights?\nJamie: They aren’t included. But these hotels offer dinner in the price [10].\nAndrea: Well, thank you very much. I'll be in touch when I’ve had a chance to look at the brochure.\nJamie: I’m pleased to help. Goodbye.",

    "Transcript": "Sandy Fisher: On behalf of LP Clubs, I’d like to welcome you all here today. My name’s Sandy Fisher and I'm one of \nthe fitness managers here. Before we start our tour of the club I'll just run through some basic information about the \nfacilities we have here, including recent improvements, and explain the types of membership available.\nOur greatest asset is probably our swimming pool which at 25 metres isn't Olympic-sized, but now we've expanded it to \neight lanes, it’s much wider [11/12]. This means there are rarely more than a couple of people at a time in each lane. \nUnfortunately, there isn’t space for an outdoor pool here [11/12] but the glass roof on the swimming pool is partly \nretractable, which means you can enjoy something of the open-air experience on warmer days.\nOur recently refurbished fitness suite has all the latest exercise equipment including ten new running machines, and a \nwide range of weight-training machines. Each member is given full training in how to operate the equipment and there is \nalways a trainer on duty to offer help and advice. Although we do have adult-only times after 6 and at certain times at \nweekends, children are well catered for. Older children continue to benefit from a wide range of tuition; anything from \ntrampolining to yoga.\nOne thing all our members appreciate about us is that we take very good care of them. This starts on day one with your \npersonal assessment. You are asked to fill in a questionnaire giving details of any health problems [13]. One of our \npersonal trainers will then go through this with you.\nThe trainer will then take you through the safety rules for using the equipment in the fitness suite [14]. During your next \nexercise session a personal trainer will work with you to make sure you understand these. It's very important to do this \nbecause we really do want to avoid having any sports injuries. There's a lot more to looking after yourself than simply \nlifting weights!\nAt the end of the personal assessment, the trainer will draw up a plan, outlining what you should try to achieve within a \nsix-week period[15]. This will then be reviewed at the end of the six weeks.\nNow, I’ll just quickly run through the types of membership we have available. All members must pay a joining fee of \n£90 [16] in addition to the rates for the monthly membership fees. Gold membership entitles you to free entry at all LP \nClubs [17]. There are now LP clubs in all major cities and towns so if you travel a lot this will be a great advantage. \nIndividual gold membership costs £50 a month and joint membership for you and your partner will cost £75.\nPremier membership is for professional people whose work commitments make it difficult for them to use the club \nduring the day and so LP gives booking preferences to Premier members at peak times [18]. This means you will find it \neasier to book the sessions at times that suit you. Reciprocal arrangements with other LP Clubs are available to Premier \nmembers. Premier membership is for individuals only, but you will be sent passes for quests every month [19]. The \nmonthly fee is £65.\nYou don’t have to have any special clothes or equipment when you visit the club. We provide robes and hairdryers in the \nchanging rooms, but it’s very important to remember your photo card because you won’t be able to get in without it [20].",

    "Transcript": "John: Erm... hello professor, I’m John Wishart. I'm working on my entry for the Global Design Competition. My tutor \nsaid you might be able to help me with it.\nProfessor: Ah, yes, I got a copy of your drawings. Come in and tell me about it. What sort of competition is it?\nJohn: Well, it’s an international design competition and we have to come up with a new design for a typical domestic \nkitchen appliance.\nProfessor: I see, and are there any special conditions? Does it have to save energy for example?\nJohn: Actually that was the focus in last year’s competition. This year’s different. We have to adopt an innovative \napproach to existing technology, using it in a way that hasn’t been thought of before [21].\nProfessor: I see, that sounds tricky. And what kitchen appliance have you chosen?\nJohn: Well, I decided to choose the dishwasher.\nProfessor: Interesting, what made you choose that?\nJohn: Well, they’re an everyday kitchen appliance in most Australian houses but they’re all pretty boring and almost \nidentical to each other. I think some people will be prepared to pay a little extra for something that looks different [22].\nProfessor: That’s a nice idea. I see you’ve called your design 'the Rockpool’; why is that?\nJohn: Basically because it looks like the rock pools you find on a beach. The top is made of glass so that you can look \ndown into it.\nProfessor: And there’s a stone at the bottom. Is that just for decoration?\nJohn: Actually it does have a function. Instead of pushing a button, you turn the stone [23].\nProfessor: So it’s really just a novel way of starting the dishwasher [23].\nJohn: That's right.\nProfessor: It’s a really nice design, but what makes it innovative?\nJohn: Well, I decided to make a dishwasher that uses carbon dioxide.\nProfessor: In place of water and detergent? How will you manage that?\nJohn: The idea is to pressurise the carbon dioxide so that it becomes a liquid. The fluid is then released into the \ndishwasher where it cleans the dishes all by itself.\nProfessor: Sounds like a brilliant idea! Your system will totally do away with the need for strong detergents. So what \nhappens once the dishes are clean?\nJohn: Well, to allow them to dry, the liquid carbon dioxide and the waste materials all go to an area called the holding \nchamber. That's where the liquid is depressurised and so it reverts to a gas [24]. Then the oil and grease are separated out \nand sent to the waste system.\nProfessor: It sounds like you’ve thought it all out very thoroughly. So, what happens to the carbon dioxide once the \nprocess is complete? Not wasted I hope.\nJohn: Actually, that’s where the real savings are made. The carbon dioxide is sent back to the cylinder and can be used \nagain and again [25].\nProfessor: What a terrific idea. Do you think it will ever be built?\nJohn: Probably not, but that’s OK.\nProfessor: Well, I'm sure a lot of positive things will come out of your design.\nProfessor: Now, you seem to have thought about everything so what exactly did you need me to help you with?\nJohn: Well, my design has made it to the final stage of the competition and, in a few months’ time, I have to give a \npresentation, and that's the part I was hoping you could help me with [26].\nProfessor: Right, well that should be easy enough. What have you managed to do so far?\nJohn: Well, I’ve got detailed drawings to show how it will work and I’ve also written a 500-word paper on it.\nProfessor: I see. Well, if you want to stand a good chance of winning you really need a model of the machine [27].\nJohn: Yes, I thought I might but I’m having a few problems.\nProfessor: What is the main difficulty so far? Let me guess - is it the materials? [28]\nJohn: Yes. I want it to look professional but everything that’s top quality is also very expensive [28].\nProfessor: Look, projects like this are very important to us. They really help lift our profile. So why don’t you talk to the\nuniversity about a grant [29]? I can help you fill out the application forms if you like.\nJohn: That would be great.\nProfessor: You’d better show me this paper you’ve written as well [30]. For a global competition such as this you need \nto make sure the technical details you’ve given [30] are accurate and thorough.\nJohn: That would be a great help.\nProfessor: Is there anything else I can do?",

    "Transcript": "Narrator: Today we continue our series on ecology and conservation with a look at a particularly endangered member of\nthe black bear family. One in ten black bears is actually born with a white coat, which is the result of a special gene that \nsurfaces in a few [31]. Local people have named it ‘the spirit bear'. And according to the legends of these communities, \nits snowy fur brings with it a special power [32]. Because of this, it has always been highly regarded by them - so much \nthat they do not speak of seeing it to anyone else. It is their way of protecting it when strangers visit the area [33].\nThe white bear’s habitat is quite interesting. The bear’s strong relationship with the old- growth rainforest is a complex \none. The white bear relies on the huge centuries-old trees in the forest in many ways. For example, the old-growth trees \nhave extremely long roots that help prevent erosion of the soil along the banks of the many fish streams [34]. Keeping \nthese banks intact is important because these streams are home to salmon, which are the bear’s main food source. In \nreturn, the bear’s feeding habits nurture the forest. As the bears eat the salmon, they discard the skin and bones in great \namounts on the forest floor, which provide vital nutrients. These produce lush vegetation that sustains thousands of other \ntypes of life forms, from birds to insects and more.\nToday, the spirit bear lives off the coast of the province of British Columbia on a few islands [35]. There is great concern \nfor their survival since it is estimated that less than two hundred of these white bears remain. The best way to protect \nthem is to make every effort to preserve the delicate balance of their forest environment - in other words, their \necosystem.\nThe greatest threat to the bear’s existence is the loss of its habitat. Over many years, logging companies have stripped the\nland by cutting down a large number of trees. In addition, they have built roads which have fractured the areas where the \nbear usually feeds [36], and many hibernation sites have also been lost . The logging of the trees along the streams has \ndamaged the places where the bears fish. To make matters worse, the number of salmon in those streams is declining \nbecause there is no legal limit on fishing [37] at the moment.\nAll these influences have a negative impact on the spirit bear’s very existence, which is made all the more fragile by the \nfact that reproduction among these bears has always been disappointingly low [38].\nAnd so, what's the situation going forward? Community organisations, environmental groups and the British Columbia \ngovernment are now working together on the problem.\nThe government is now requiring logging companies to adopt a better logging method [39], which is a positive step. \nHowever, these measures alone may not be sufficient to ensure a healthy population of the spirit bear in the future.\nOther steps also need to be taken. While it is important to maintain the spirit bear’s habitat, there also needs to be more \nemphasis on its expansion [40]. The move is justified as it will also create space for other bears that are losing their \nhomes...",
