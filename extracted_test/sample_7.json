    "Transcript": "Student: Good morning!\nWoman: Good morning - can I help you?\nStudent: Yes, is this where we register for the Beyond 2000 Conference?\nWoman: Yes? What's your name and I'll get your conference bag.\nStudent: Well, I haven't actually registered yet. I was told I'd be able to register today, so I hope that's OK. I've just \narrived in Melbourne.\nWoman: That should be fine, if you're a student. I'll need to take your details though. So can I have your full name?\nStudent: Yes, sure. It's Melanie Mitchell .\nWoman: Is that M-I-T-C-H-E double L [1]?\nStudent: Yes, that's right [1] and that's Ms not Miss.\nWoman: OK, fair enough! And what's your address, Melanie?\nStudent: I live in student accommodation at Sydney University. So my address there is Room 66 [2], Women's College, \nNewtown.\nWoman: OK. And which Faculty are you studying in?\nStudent: I'm in the Faculty of Education [3] - I'm doing a Master's in Primary School Teaching.\nWoman: Right, and may I see your student card because I need to verify that you're a current student?\nStudent: Yes, sure. Here it is. My number is ... 9-9-4-5-7-8-E-D [4] .\nWoman: OK - now do you want to attend all three days? The conference runs from Thursday to Saturday.\nStudent: Yes, I think so - if I can afford it. What does it cost?\nWoman: Well, you're eligible for a student discount - which makes it $15 for a day registration or $40 for the three days, \nthough it is possible to register for half a day only.\nStudent: I'll register for all three days, please. [5]\nWoman: Good. Now, will you be requiring accommodation while you're here in Melbourne?\nStudent: Yes, I suppose I will. What's available?\nWoman: Well, we have several levels of accommodation. You can share a room with another student for $25 a night.\nStudent: Uhm..\nWoman: Or you can have your own room but share the bathroom - I believe it's just down the corridor - that's $45.\nStudent: Right.\nWoman: Or you can have a single room with your own bathroom .\nStudent: I don't mind sharing a room. On second thoughts, yes I do - I'll have my own room, but I'll share the bathroom. \n[6]\nWoman: Right ... Now the conference fee does not include meals though you d o get tea and coffee in the breaks. Shall I \nput you down for lunch - that's an extra $10 a day and there's the conference dinner on Friday night which is $25... oh, \nand what about breakfast?\nStudent: Hang on a minute... it's all starting to sound rather expensive! I'll have the lunch but not the dinner or breakfast \n- if that's OK? [7]\nWoman: Perfectly OK. Now ... a couple of other things - there are a number of special interest groups organised - they're\nknown as SIG's and you're asked to nominate your preference. They'll take place on the Friday afternoon and Saturday \nmorning but they're filling up quickly which is why you need to nominate now.\nStudent: Right. What are the SIG's?\nWoman: Well, there are six altogether. Let's see, on Friday you have a choice between Computers in Education or \nTeaching Reading Skills...\nStudent: Hmm...\nWoman: ... or a session on Catering for the Gifted Child.\nStudent: Oh they all sound interesting but technology in the classroom is really my area of interest rather than reading, \nso I'll go for that [8]. I can probably read up on the gifted child topic myself.\nWoman: Right ... And then the Saturday options are: a session on Cultural Differences; or there's Music in the Primary \nCurriculum or you could go to the one on Gender Issues in the Classroom.\nStudent: Wow! Can I go to them all? They all sound fascinating.\nWoman: Afraid not.\nStudent: Well, I am really interested in how boys and girls behave differently, even when they are very young, so I'd \nbetter opt for the third session [9] even though the Cultural Differences SIG is probably really interesting, too.\nWoman: Right!\nStudent: ... and the Music option would be ...\nWoman: And how would you like to pay? We accept most credit cards - or bank cheques but not personal cheques, I'm \nafraid. Been caught out too often before - and cash, of course. We never say 'No' to cash.\nStudent: I'll have to put it on my card [10] because I don't have enough cash on me, right now.\nWoman: That's fine. Enjoy your time here with us in Melbourne...",

    "Transcript": "Woman: Right, let's move on to the beaches here which are absolutely beautiful. You do have over a hundred to choose \nfrom, they're mostly sandy beaches and they vary from the largest which is two and a half kilometres long, to tiny sandy \ncoves. But there are a few that I'd really recommend you to visit.\nSo looking at this pamphlet, first of all there's Bandela beach. This beach is one kilometre away from the old fishing \nvillage of Bandela [11], which is a beautiful spot. If you park in the car park behind it, there's a small path which leads \ndown to the bay. It's very pretty because the whole beach is backed by pine trees [12] so its very sheltered. The beach \nitself is very clean and the water is shallow and safe. That together with the soft sand make it an ideal beach for children \nand non-swimmers.\nA little further round the coast, again to the east, in the eastern corner of the island, is the spectacular Da Porlata beach \nwhich is basically a long inlet. The land around this beach is marshland, it's all marsh [13], and there's a stream which \nwinds through it and the stream goes into the sea, and the beach has lovely pale gold sand. Access to this beach is quite \ntricky and not for the less energetic! You have to go down a long flight of steps - 190 to be exact. But you'll be relieved \nto know that there's also a road which winds down to a car parking area. When you're level with the sea, there is a \nhandful of shops and bars and you can hire sunbeds and umbrellas [14] .\nContinuing round the island, just past the Tip of Cain is the next beach I'd suggest you visit and this is San Gett. Why? \nBecause there isn't a beach longer than this on the island [15]. If you want to know, it's exactly two and a half kilometres \nlong and that's a bonus because it means it never gets overcrowded. It has golden sand and clear, blue water shelving into\nthe sea. There are several beach restaurants to choose from and watersports are available when the water is calm. But \ncheck first. This beach operates a flag system [16] as the sea can get rough and you should always swim between the \nflags. There's a large car park which gives you easy access to the eastern end of the beach but the western end is much \nquieter and more wild as it is harder to reach.\nBlanaka is another popular beach — just in the north-west corner of the island [17]. It has incredibly white sand and \nsparkling water. There is ample car parking here and plenty of bars and restaurants. Blanaka has white cliffs all around it \n[18] and for those of you who'd like a little more to do than just lazing on the beach, there are caves here which you can \nexplore in the cliffs and you can also dive into the water from rock platforms along the side of the cove.\nWell, my final recommendation for today is Dissidor. Now this beach isn't quite as easy to get to as the others I've talked \nabout. It's quite a remote little beach tucked away here next to Blanaka. You can reach Dissidor by a steep slope which \ngoes over some sandbanks [19] . The beach itself is small and pretty, with reddish-coloured sand and some stony areas on\nits eastern side. Despite being quite small the bathing is good and you can also go fishing here from the rocks at either \nside. It's a good idea to take some food and drink with you [20] if you decide to go here as there's only one little bar \nwhich isn't always open.",

    "Transcript": "Announcer: The start of a new academic year is a challenge for booksellers. Lee Rogers talks to one major book store \nmanager.\nLee: Jenny Farrow, you're the manager of Dalton Books - and you sell an awful lot of books to students, don't you?\nJenny: Yes! We do.\nLee: How do you manage to make sure that you're going to have the books students need when all the new courses \nbegin?\nJenny: Basically, we make preparations long before they arrive. Like all other major book retailers, we have a database \nof information, and using that, we contact course conveners in May and ask them to send us their booklists [21].\nLee: How many books are we talking about?\nJenny: For one course?\nLee: Yes, as an example.\nJenny: An average course requires about 30 books. We ask lecturers to indicate whether a book is what we call 'essential'\nreading... you know, the students simply have to get it, or whether it's what they would term 'recommended' reading \n[22]or whether it's just a supplementary text that they tend to refer to as 'background' reading.\nLee: What about predicted buyers?\nJenny: It's not a perfect system unfortunately. If a lecturer tells us that he expects us to sell 100 copies of a book, we \nknow that we could actually sell anything from 50 to 150. That's why in practice, when it comes to ordering, it's a lot \nsafer to go by the previous year's sales figures [23] - if that's possible of course... if we've sold the book before. We also \nbuild other factors into the equation including the type of course that the books are for, the students' year group [24] and \na measure of our own judgement.\nLee: And these criteria make a fairly accurate guide?\nJenny: As accurate as we can be, yes.\nLee: What about the publishers? Do they take an active role in promoting new books?\nJenny: Certainly. The academic and professional publishing market is worth about ?700 million a year, so publishers go \nto some lengths to make sure their books are known. The standard procedure they use is to mail out catalogues to \nlecturers or colleges and universities [25], that's been the main form of promotion for years. Now, of course, they can \nalso post details of new or revised works on websites. Some even go so far as writing individual letters to the appropriate\nlecturers [26] in order to let them know what's coming up.\nLee: The lecturers then contact you if they're interested ...\nJenny: That's right. The publishers send us - the book sellers - 'inspection copies' [27]. Lecturers can then get a free copy\nand decide whether it's going to be suitable for their course.\nLee: And how does it work with the students? What are they looking for and who helps them most?\nJenny: I think lecturers are best placed to understand the students' needs. Often the critical issue is what represents value \nfor money for students [28]. This is more important than price per se.\nLee: Do students actually buy books before they start the course?\nJenny: Apparently a large proportion of students wait to see what they need. Students have a firm idea of what \nconstitutes a good book so they tend to give themselves time to look at all the options before making a choice.\nThey tend to go for books that are clear and easy to use [29,30] . Often the texts that their lecturers recommend turn out \nto be too academic and remain here on our shelves.",

    "Transcript": "Lecturer: I'd like to introduce Rebecca Bramwell, an artist and illustrator, who has come along today to talk to you all \nabout getting your first job or commission as an artist. Over to you Rebecca.\nRebecca: Thank you for inviting me. I remember when I graduated back in 1983, I was very excited about getting my \nfirst commission. My degree was in Fine Art and I'd worked long and hard to get it. I was an enthusiastic student and I \nnever found it difficult to find the incentive to paint [31 - not the answer, but a contrast to what follows]. I think as a \nstudent you're pushed along by fellow students and tutors and the driving force is there. However, when you leave \ncollege you find yourself saying things like 'I'll have one more cup of coffee and then I'll sit down to work'. I hate to \nadmit it but I say it myself. Suddenly it isn't finding the inspiration or getting the right paper that's a problem, it's you \n[31].\nIn my view, there are a number of reasons why this happens. It's a real challenge making a decent living as a new artist \n[32], you have to find a market for your work, often you work freelance and need to take samples or portfolios of your \nwork from place to place... these experiences are common to a lot of professional people, but artists also have to bare \ntheir souls to the world in a way, more than anything they want praise, if people don't like what they create then it can be \na very emotional and upsetting experience hearing them say this [33].\nI began to realise that these problems were preventing me from having a career in art and so I decided to experiment. I \nwas a painter but I started to dabble in illustration, drawing pictures for books, cards, and this offered me the opportunity \nto become more emotionally detached from my work [34 - she wasn't subjective (emotional) anymore, therefore she \nbecame more objective]. I was no longer producing images from the heart but developing images for a specified \nsubject, taking a more practical approach . I began to develop a collection of my illustrations which I put into a portfolio \nand started to carry around with me to show prospective clients and employers. But it was still tricky because publishers, \nfor example, want to know that your drawings will reproduce well in a book, but without having had any work published,\nit's hard to prove this [35]. Having a wonderful portfolio or collection of original artwork is, of course, a first step but \nwhat most potential clients would like to see is printed artwork and without this 'evidence' they tend to hold back still \nwhen it comes to offering a contract .\nWell, I overcame this problem in two ways. And I suppose this is my advice to you on preparing your portfolio of your \nbest work. The first way was by submitting my work for a competition [36], and the one I chose was for a horoscope \ndesign and was sponsored by a top women's magazine. There are a few of these competitions each year and they offer \nnew illustrators an opportunity to showcase their work. The other approach I took was to design and print some mock-up \npages of a book [37]. In other words, I placed some of my illustrations next to some text in order to demonstrate how my \nwork would look when it was printed.\nPerhaps I was lucky in that I had taken a degree that provided me with all-round creative skills so that I could vary my \nstyle and wasn't limited to a certain technique [38]. I think that is important. The art world, and many other creative \nfields, do try to pigeon-hole people into snug boxes with an accompanying label. I think you should try to resist this if \nyou feel it happening to you. If you don't, you'll find it difficult to have new work accepted if you try to develop your \nstyle at a later stage in your career. Nevertheless, when you start out and particularly when you're going for an interview, \nit's important not to confuse people by having a lot of different examples in your portfolio. One remedy for this is to \nseparate your work into distinct categories [39]. In my case, I did this by dividing my design-inspired illustrations from \nmy paintings. It is then easier to analyse the market suited to each portfolio; such as magazines, book jackets, CD covers \netc. Working under two names is also useful [40] as it clarifies the different approaches and offers a distinction between \nthem.",
