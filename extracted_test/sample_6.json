    "Transcript": "Man: Hello 'Paragliders' Paradise'. How can I help you?\nMaria: Oh hi. I'm interested in doing a course in paragliding.\nMan: Which course are you interested in?\nMaria: Well, I'm not sure. What's available?\nMan: Well ... we've got the introductory course which lasts for two days.\nMaria: OK.\nMan: Or there's the 4-day beginners' course which is what most people do first. I'd tend to recommend that one. And \nthere's also the elementary pilot course which takes five to six days depending on conditions.\nMaria: We might try the beginner's course. What sort of prices are we looking at?\nMan: The introductory is $190; the beginner's course, which is what you'd probably be looking at, is $320 - no, sorry \n330 - it's just gone up[1] - and the pilot course is $430.\nMaria: Right.\nMan: And you also have to become a member of our club so that you're insured. That'll cost you $12 a day. Everyone \nhas to take out insurance, you see.\nMaria: Does that cover me if I break a leg?\nMan: No, I'm afraid not - it's only 3rd party and covers you against damage to other people or their belongings[2] , but \nnot theft or injury, You would need to take out your own personal accident insurance.\nMaria: I see! And what's the best way to get to your place? By public transport or could we come by bike? We're pretty \nkeen cyclists [3] .\nMan: It's difficult by public transport although there is a bus from Newcastle; most people get here by car, though, 'cos \nwe're a little off the beaten track. But you could ride here OK. I'll send you a map. Just let me take down a few details. \nWhat's your name?\nMaria: Maria Gentle.\nMan: And your address, Maria?\nMaria: Well, I'm a student staying with a family in Newcastle.\nMan: So it's care of ...\nMaria: Care of Mr. and Mrs. McDonald [4] .\nMan: Like the hamburgers!\nMaria: Yes, exactly.\nMan: McDonald ...\nMaria: The post office box address is probably best. It's PO Box 676 [5]. Newcastle.\nMan: Is there a fax number there, because I could fax you the information?\nMaria: Yes, actually, there is. It's 0249 that's for Newcastle and then double seven five four three one [6].\nMan: OK. Now if you decide to do one of our courses, you'll need to book in advance and to pay when you book. How \nwould you be paying?\nMaria: By credit card , if that's OK. Do you take Visa? [7]\nMan: Yes, fine. We take all major cards, including Visa.\nMaria: OK then. Thanks very much.\nMaria: Hi, Pauline.\nPauline: Hi, Maria! What's that you're reading?\nMaria: Just some information from a paragliding school - it looks really good fun. Do you fancy a go at paragliding?\nPauline: Sure! Do you have to buy lots of equipment and stuff?\nMaria: Not really. The school provides the equipment but we'd have to take a few things along.\nPauline: Such as?\nMaria: Well it says here. Clothes: wear stout boots, so no sneakers or sandals I suppose, and clothes suitable for an \nactive day in the hills, preferably a long-sleeved t-shirt [8] . That's probably in case you land in the stinging nettles! It \nalso says we should bring a packed lunch. We do not recommend soft drinks or flasks of coffee. Water is really the best \nthing to drink. We'd also need to bring suntan lotion and something to protect your head from the sun! [8]\nPauline: OK that sounds reasonable. And where would we stay?\nMaria: Well look! They seem to operate a campsite too [9], because it says here that it's only $10 a day to pitch a tent . \nThat'd be fine, wouldn't it? And that way we'd save quite a bit because even a cheap hotel would cost money.\nPauline: Urn..or perhaps we could stay in a bed and breakfast nearby [9]. It gives a couple of names here we could ring. \nI think I might prefer that. Hotels and youth hostels would all be miles away from the farm and I don't fancy a caravan.\nMaria: No, I agree. But let's take a tent and pray for good weather.\nPauline: OK - let's do it. What about next\nMaria: No, I can't - I'm going on a geography field trip.\nPauline: ....and then it's the weekend before the exams and I really need to study.\nMaria: OK, then. Let's make it the one after the exams [10].\nPauline: Fine - we'll need a break by then. Can you ring and ...",

    "Transcript": "Reporter: The Goodwood Museum is currently celebrating some of the most extravagant types of car design in its \nfestival of speed. Here's our reporter Vincent Freed, who's on site, to tell us about some of the cars on display.\nWell, here I am, standing in front of one of the most prestigious cars ever built, the Duesenberg, a fantastically expensive,\nluxurious car built in the early part of the 20th century and bearing all the glamorous qualities of the jazz age. How many\nwere there? Well, only 473 Duesenberg J-types were ever built [11] and the model here is one of the rarest.\nEach had a short 125-inch chassis or framework and the body was always in the form of an open two-seater [12] .\nThe technology behind the car's 6.9-litre engine was extraordinary. It featured capsules of mercury in the engines to \nabsorb vibration and provide an incredibly smooth ride [13].\nIn fact, these cars offered unparalleled performance, in an age when 160 kilometres per hour was considered very fast, \nthe Duesenberg promised a top speed of 180 kilometres per hour [14] and could do 140 kilometres per hour in second \ngear.\nDuesenberg, who designed the car, sold it as a frame and engine [15] ... this was typical of the age again and many \nprestige manufacturers such as Rolls-Royce did exactly the same. Owners able to afford the hefty $9,000 price tag for the\nbasic car would then commission a coachwork company to build a body tailored to their own individual requirements.\nThe Duesenberg's great attraction for the driver was its instrument panel which offered all the usual features but also \nseveral others including a stop-watch [16].\nIt was the Duesenberg's technology that lay behind its success as a racing car and they dominated the American racing \nscene in the 1920s winning the Indianapolis Grand Prix in 1924, '25 and '27.\nOn to another celebrity, the 1922 Leyat Helica. Only 30 of these French propeller cars were built [17] and the model here\nat Goodwood, which was the fourth to be made, is thought to be the only surviving example still capable of running.\nThe brains behind this car was Marcel Leyat who was an aviation pioneer first and foremost, and the influence of flying \nis quite apparent in the car. The Leyat very strongly resembles a light aircraft [18] with its front propeller but in this case \nit's minus any wings [19] of course!\nIt's quite odd to think that this car was whirring through France, just as the Duesenberg was blasting down roads at 160 \nkilometres per hour across the Atlantic. The Leyats were used regularly in France in the 1920s and were even produced \nin saloon and van form, as well as two-seater. The Leyat matched its propeller drive with its equally bizarre steering \nwhich used the rear rather than the front wheels [20]! But despite looking rather frail, it was a tough machine. In fact, \nwhen troops tried to steal it during the Second World War, the car's baffling design was clearly beyond the would-be \nthieves and it ended up being driven into a tree, breaking the propeller.",

    "Transcript": "Tutor: Good morning everyone. Well I think we can start straightaway by getting Rosie and Mike to do their \npresentation. Would you like to start, Rosie?\nRosie: Yes, well, urn, we've done a survey on local entertainment. Basically, we tried to find out how students feel about \nthe entertainment in the town and how much they use it.\nMike: Yes, so we've called our project 'Out and About' [21] Mind the capitalisation as it is a title.\nTutor: Yes, that's a good title! 'Out and About'.\nRosie: We wanted to find out how well students use the entertainment facilities in town ... whether they get to see the \nlatest plays, films ... that kind of thing.\nTutor: Now, we have our own facilities on campus of course ...\nRosie: Yes, we deliberately omitted those as we really wanted to examine outside entertainment in the town as opposed \nto on the university campus. [22]\nMike: Actually there were a lot of areas to choose from but in the end we limited ourselves to looking at three general \ncategories: cinema, theatre and music.\nTutor: Right.\nRosie: OK. Well, first of all cinema. In the town, there are three main places where you can see films. There's the new \nmulti-screen cinema complex, the old Park cinema, and a late-night Odeon.\nMike: So if you look at this chart ... in terms of audience size, the multi-screen complex accounts for 75% of all cinema \nseats [23], the Park Cinema, accounts for 20% of seats and the late-night Odeon has just 5% of seats .\nRosie: As you probably know, the Complex and the Park show all the latest films, while the late-night cinema tends to \nshow cult films. So, when we interviewed the students, we thought the Complex would be the most popular choice of \ncinema ... but surprisingly it was the late-night Odeon [24] .\nMike: Yeah, and most students said that if they wanted to see a new film, they waited for it to show at the Park because \nthe complex is more expensive and further out of town so you have to pay more to get there as well.\nTutor: Yes, and that adds to the cost, of course, and detracts from the popularity [24], evidently .\nRosie: Well, next, we looked at theatres. The results here were interesting because, as you know, there's a theatre on \ncampus, which is popular. But there's also the Stage Theatre in town, which is very old and architecturally quite \nbeautiful. And there's the large, modern theatre, the Ashtop, that has recently been built.\nTutor: So you just looked at the two theatres in town?\nMike: Yes. But the thing about the theatres is that there's a whole variety of seat prices. Also, the types of performance \nvary ... so students tend to buy seats at both and like using both for different reasons [25] and if they want cheap seats at \nthe Ashtop, they can just sit further from the front.\nRosie: What we did find that was very interesting is that there are periods during the year when students seem to go to \nthe theatre and periods when they go to the cinema and we really think that's to do with budget. If you look at this graph, \nyou can see that there's a peak around November/December when they go to the theatre more and then a period in April/\nMay when neither is particularly popular [26] and then theatre viewing seems to trail off virtually while the cinema \nbecomes quite popular in June/July [26] .\nTutor: Hmm. I think you're probably right about your conclusions.\nMike: Well, lastly we looked at music. And this time we were really investigating the sort of small music clubs that offer\nthings like folk or specialise in local bands.\nTutor: So not musicals as such.\nMike: That's right.\nRosie: We looked at three small music venues and we examined the quality of the entertainment and venue and gave a \nranking for these: a cross meaning that the quality was poor, a tick meaning it was OK and two ticks for excellent. First \nof all, The Blues Club, which obviously specialises in blues music. This was a pretty small place and the seating was \nminimal so we didn't give that a very good rating. [27]\nMike: No! We don't recommend that one really.\nRosie: Then The Sansue which plays a lot of South American music was a big place, very lively, good performers so two\nticks for that one [28].\nThe Pier Hotel is a folk venue ... a good place for local and up-and-coming folk artists to play. Not the best of venues as \nit's in a basement and a bit dark but the quality of the entertainment was reasonable and the lighting was very warm so \nwe felt it deserved an average rating. [29]\nFinally, there's the Baldrock Cafe which features big rock bands and is pretty popular with students and we enjoyed \nourselves there as well, so top marks for that one. [30]",

    "Transcript": "Lecturer: In the last lecture, we looked at the adverse effects of desert dust on global climate. Today we're going to \nexamine more closely what causes dust storms and what other effects they can have. As you know, dust storms have \nalways been a feature of desert climates, but what we want to focus on today is the extent to which human activity is \ncausing them [31]. And it is this trend that I want to look at, because it has wide-ranging implications.\nSo - what are these human activities ? Well, there are two main types that affect the wind erosion process, and thus the \nfrequency of dust storms. There are activities that break up naturally wind-resistant surfaces such as off-road vehicle use \nand construction and there are those that remove protective vegetation cover from soils, for example, mainly farming and\ndrainage. [32] In many cases the two effects occur simultaneously which adds to the problem.\nLet's look at some real examples and see what I'm talking about. Perhaps the best-known example of agricultural impact \non desert dust is the creation of the USA's 'dust bowl' in the 1930s. The dramatic rise in the number of dust storms during\nthe latter part of that decade was the result of farmers mismanaging their land. In fact, choking dust storms became so \ncommonplace that the decade became known as the 'Dirty Thirties'. [33]\nResearchers observed a similar, but more prolonged, increase in dustiness in West Africa between the 1960s and the \n1980s when the frequency of the storms rose to 80 a year and the dust was so thick that visibility was reduced to 1,0 \nmetres. This was a hazard to pilots and road users.\nIn places like Arizona, the most dangerous dust clouds are those generated by dry thunderstorms. [34] Here, this type of \nstorm is so common that the problem inspired officials to develop an alert system to warn people of oncoming \nthunderstorms. When this dust is deposited it causes all sorts of problems for machine operators. [35] It can penetrate the \nsmallest nooks and crannies and play havoc with the way things operate because most of the dust is made up of quartz \nwhich is very hard.\nAnother example - the concentration of dust originating from the Sahara has risen steadily since the mid-1960s.\nThis increase in wind erosion has coincided with a prolonged drought, [36] which has gripped the Sahara's southern \nfringe. Drought is commonly associated with an increase in dust-raising activity but it's actually caused by low rainfall \nwhich results in vegetation dying off.\nOne of the foremost examples of modern human-induced environmental degradation is the drying up of the Aral Sea in \nCentral Asia. Its ecological demise dates from the 1950s when intensive irrigation began in the then Central Asian [37] \nrepublics of the USSR. This produced a dramatic decline in the volume of water entering the sea from its two major \ntributaries. In 1960, the Aral Sea was the fourth-largest lake in the world, but since that time it has lost two-thirds of its \nvolume [38], its surface area has halved and its water level has dropped by more than 216 metres. A knock-on effect of \nthis ecological disaster has been the release of significant new sources of wind-blown material, as the water level has \ndropped.\nAnd the problems don't stop there. The salinity of the lake has increased [39] so that it is now virtually the same as sea \nwater. This means that the material that is blown from the dry bed of the Aral Sea is highly saline. Scientists believe it is \nadversely affecting crops [40] around the sea because salts are toxic to plants.",
