Section 1
Examiner: You will hear a conversation between Mark, a university orientation guide, and Laura, a new student, discussing the layout of the New Academic Wing. First, you have some time to look at questions 1 to 5.

(Pause 30 seconds)

Examiner: Now listen carefully and answer questions 1 to 5.

Mark: Hi Laura, welcome to the university! I'm Mark, one of the orientation guides. You look a bit lost. Are you looking for the New Academic Wing?

Laura: Oh, hello Mark. Yes, I am. It's my first day, and I have a lecture in there, but I can't quite make sense of this map. Could you help me understand the layout of the ground floor?

Mark: Of course, happy to help. Let's look at your map together. See this entrance point here? That's where we are right now. Directly in front of us, as you walk through the main doors, is the central reception desk. That's for general enquiries and visitor information.

Laura: Okay, I see that. So, what's to the left and right of the reception area?

Mark: Right. If you're standing at the reception desk, and you turn immediately to your left, you'll find a very large space. That's actually our biggest lecture venue, **Lecture Hall 1**. It's used for all the major introductory lectures and plenary sessions. Quite impressive when it's full.

Laura: Wow, that's good to know. So, it's marked as '1' on my diagram, correct? So that's Lecture Hall 1.

Mark: Exactly. And then, if you go to the opposite side of the reception, to your right, you'll find another large lecture space, though a little smaller than the first. That's **Lecture Hall 2**, often used for second-year courses or larger seminar groups. So, that's number '2' on your map.

Laura: Got it. So, '1' is Lecture Hall 1, and '2' is Lecture Hall 2. That makes sense. What about further down the corridor?

Mark: Okay, so if you walk past the reception desk and continue straight down the main corridor, the first significant area you'll come to, on your left-hand side, is a popular spot, especially during breaks. It's the **university cafe**, where you can grab coffee, snacks, or even a light lunch. It gets quite busy around midday.

Laura: Ah, a cafe! That's essential. So, that would be position '3' on the map, next to Lecture Hall 2?

Mark: Precisely. Now, if you keep walking a little further past the cafe, still on the left side, you'll see a series of smaller rooms. The first one you encounter, just after the cafe, is **Seminar Room A**. These are designed for more interactive classes, workshops, and smaller group discussions. So, '4' is Seminar Room A.

Laura: Okay, Seminar Room A. And what's at the very end of the corridor, still on that same side, past Seminar Room A?

Mark: At the very end, yes, you'll find the **restrooms**. They're clearly signposted, both for male and female facilities. They're at the furthest point from the entrance on the left-hand side of the main corridor. So, that's where '5' would be on your diagram.

Laura: Perfect! That clarifies things a lot. Thank you so much, Mark.

Mark: You're very welcome, Laura. If you have any more questions, just ask. And good luck with your first lecture!

Examiner: That is the end of Section 1. You now have half a minute to check your answers.

(Pause 30 seconds)

Examiner: Now turn to Section 2.


Section 3
You will hear a university lecturer talking about the evolving role of university libraries.

Good morning, everyone, and welcome to today's session of 'Academic Study Skills for Postgraduate Students'. My name is Dr. Eleanor Vance, and I'll be guiding you through this module. Today, we're diving into a topic that's often overlooked but remains absolutely central to academic success, especially at the postgraduate level: the evolving role of university libraries. Many of you might picture libraries as quiet places filled with dusty books, but I assure you, that image is far from the contemporary reality.

Historically, university libraries were, indeed, primarily repositories of physical knowledge: vast collections of books, journals, and archival materials. Their main functions revolved around acquisition, cataloging, and providing access to these resources. The librarian's role was largely curatorial and instructional, guiding students through card catalogs and reference sections. These traditional functions remain important, of course, but the digital revolution has fundamentally reshaped the landscape.

The advent of the internet and digital technologies brought about a paradigm shift. Suddenly, information became instantaneously accessible, often from anywhere. This presented both immense opportunities and significant challenges for libraries. On the one hand, libraries could expand their reach exponentially through online databases, e-journals, and digital archives. On the other hand, they faced pressures regarding funding, the 'digital divide' among students, and the overwhelming volume of information, much of which lacks academic rigor. The traditional print model became unsustainable as resources shifted online, leading to a necessary re-evaluation of services.

So, what do modern university libraries look like? They are no longer just quiet study halls, though those spaces certainly still exist. They've become dynamic learning hubs, deeply integrated into the university's research and teaching missions. They offer a diverse array of services designed to support students and faculty in navigating the complexities of the digital academic world.

For instance, one of their increasingly critical roles is in digital literacy education. Libraries now regularly run workshops on effective online searching, evaluating sources for credibility, and understanding academic integrity in the digital realm. This goes far beyond simply finding a book; it's about critical engagement with information.

Another significant development is their involvement in research data management. With the rise of 'big data' and increasingly stringent requirements from funding bodies regarding data sharing and preservation, libraries are stepping in to provide expertise and infrastructure. They assist researchers with data archiving, metadata creation, and ensuring compliance with institutional and ethical guidelines. This is a complex area, and the library often serves as a central point of contact for researchers.

Furthermore, modern libraries are fostering collaborative learning environments. They provide flexible spaces equipped with technology for group work, presentations, and interdisciplinary projects, moving beyond the traditional individual study carrel. They also champion Open Access initiatives, helping researchers publish their work freely online, increasing its visibility and impact. This requires significant negotiation skills and understanding of intellectual property rights.

While physical books are still available and valued, the emphasis has definitely shifted. Libraries are less about being a warehouse for printed materials and more about being a conduit for information skills, research support, and creating a vibrant intellectual community. They provide access to software, specialized databases, and often house media production suites.

Looking ahead, university libraries are likely to continue evolving. We might see further integration of Artificial Intelligence tools to personalize resource discovery, an even stronger focus on supporting diverse learning styles, and a deepened role as community anchors, not just for the university but potentially for the wider public too. They are constantly adapting to new technologies and pedagogical approaches, ensuring they remain indispensable partners in education and research.

Remember, the library is not just a building; it's a suite of services and expert staff dedicated to empowering you in your academic journey. I strongly encourage all of you, particularly postgraduates, to familiarize yourselves with the full range of resources available at our university library. Thank you.
