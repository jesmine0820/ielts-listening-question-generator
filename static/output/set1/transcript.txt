Part Part 1
Narrator: You will hear a telephone conversation between a student, Sarah Miller, and a university administrator about registering for an IELTS examination. First, you have some time to look at questions 1 to 5.

Narrator: You will see that there is an example that has been done for you. On this occasion only, the conversation relating to this will be played first.

Receptionist: Good morning, IELTS Registration Office. How can I help you today?
Sarah: Hi there. I'm calling because I'd like to get some information and hopefully register for the IELTS Academic test. I need it for my university application.
Receptionist: Of course, we can help you with that. We have several test dates available. Are you looking for a specific month?
Sarah: Yes, I was hoping for a test in November. Do you have any slots available around the middle of the month?
Receptionist: Let me just check our system for you... Yes, we do have an exam scheduled for the 15th of November. Would that date work for you?
Sarah: Yes, the 15th of November sounds perfect!

Narrator: The receptionist says the exam is on the 15th of November, so '15th' has been written as an example. Now we shall begin. You should answer the questions as you listen because you will not hear the recording a second time. Listen carefully and complete questions 1 to 10.

Receptionist: Okay, great. So, the 15th of (1) November is confirmed for your IELTS Academic test. To complete your registration, I'll need to take down some personal details. Could you please state your full name for me?
Sarah: Certainly. My name is Sarah Miller. That's Sarah, S-A-R-A-H, and Miller, M-I-L-L-E-R.
Receptionist: Thank you, Sarah. And your date of birth, please?
Sarah: It's the 24th of (2) July, 1998. I celebrated my birthday not too long ago.
Receptionist: Happy belated birthday! So, 24th July, 1998. Got it. Next, could I have your best contact phone number? A mobile number is usually easiest.
Sarah: Yes, my mobile is 07700 900 (3) 578. I've had that number for ages.
Receptionist: Thank you. 07700 900 578. And an email address where we can send your confirmation and results?
Sarah: Sure, it's sarahm@ and then (4) university.com. That's U-N-I-V-E-R-S-I-T-Y dot com, all one word.
Receptionist: Perfect. And your current postal address, please? We'll need this for any official correspondence.
Sarah: It's 14 River Street, Newton, (5) Bristol. The postcode is 2012.
Receptionist: 14 River Street, Newton, Bristol, postcode 2012. Thank you. Now, regarding the exam fee, the current cost for the Academic IELTS test is (6) £220. Is that acceptable for you?
Sarah: Yes, £220 is fine. What payment methods do you accept?
Receptionist: We accept various methods. The most convenient for most applicants is a direct (7) bank transfer. We can also process card payments over the phone, but many prefer the transfer option.
Sarah: A bank transfer would be best for me, thank you.
Receptionist: Excellent. Moving on, do you have any special requirements for the test day? For instance, if you require a larger font size for the test materials or extra time?
Sarah: Yes, I do actually. Due to a diagnosed medical condition, I'll need a (8) separate room for the listening test to ensure I'm not distracted. I have a doctor's note, which I can bring in or send to you.
Receptionist: A separate room for the listening component. We can certainly accommodate that, Sarah. Please remember to bring your doctor's note with you on the test day, or email it to us beforehand if possible. And finally, we require details of the identification you'll bring to the test. Which type of ID will you be using?
Sarah: I'll be using my passport.
Receptionist: And could you provide the passport number for our records, please?
Sarah: Yes, it's (9) P908765432. Just to confirm, that's the letter P, followed by nine-zero-eight-seven-six-five-four-three-two.
Receptionist: Thank you. P908765432. That's all the personal details for now. Just one more important thing, Sarah. The final registration deadline for the 15th November test is the (10) first of December. So, please ensure your payment, and if possible, your doctor's note for your special requirements, are submitted by that date to confirm your place.
Sarah: Oh, the first of December. That's good to know. I'll make sure to get everything sorted by then. Thank you very much for all your help.
Receptionist: You're most welcome, Sarah. We look forward to seeing you on the 15th of November. Is there anything else I can assist you with today regarding your registration?
Sarah: No, that's everything for now. You've been very helpful. Goodbye!
Receptionist: Goodbye.

Part Part 2
Narrator: You will hear a university accommodation officer giving a talk to new students about different types of accommodation available.

First, you have some time to look at questions 11 to 20.

(Pause 30 seconds)

Narrator: Now listen carefully and answer questions 11 to 20.

Accommodation Officer: Good morning, everyone, and a warm welcome to City University! My name is Sarah Miller, and I'm the Head of Student Accommodation Services. Today, I'm going to run through the various housing options available to you as students here, covering everything from university-managed properties to private rentals. We know that finding the right place to live is crucial for your academic success and overall well-being, so we aim to provide comprehensive support.

Let's start by looking at our university-managed options. We have several types of accommodation directly provided by the university. The first two categories are our Halls of Residence, commonly known as 'halls'.

Option A covers our University Halls with Catering provided. These halls are often popular with first-year undergraduates, especially international students who are new to the country. A significant advantage here is that they offer a full meal plan, usually including breakfast and dinner on weekdays, and brunch on weekends. This means you don't have to worry about cooking or budgeting for groceries, making it an excellent transition for many. These halls are often recommended for new international students in their first year, as they provide an immediate community and essential support services, which addresses question 17. The rent for these halls includes all utility bills – electricity, water, heating, and internet – so there are no unexpected extra costs. This full meal plan is a key feature, directly addressing question 12.

Our next category is Option B: University Halls, which are self-catered. These are similar to the catered halls in terms of community and location, but without the meal plan. Students here have access to shared kitchen facilities, so you can cook your own meals and manage your own diet. This offers more independence in cooking compared to catered halls. A major benefit, common across all university halls, is that the rent typically includes all utility bills. For instance, in our self-catered halls, you pay one fixed fee, and that covers everything – electricity, water, heating, and high-speed internet. This directly answers question 11. Moreover, all university halls, both catered and self-catered, benefit from dedicated on-site welfare and support staff. Each hall has a Residential Life team, including wardens and student residential assistants, who are there to provide pastoral care, resolve issues, and ensure a safe and supportive environment. This strong network of support staff, which also applies to self-catered halls, directly links to question 19.

Moving on to more independent university-managed options. We have Option C: University Apartments. These are typically self-contained units, ranging from one-bedroom flats to larger apartments, and are designed for couples, students with families, or mature students who prefer more privacy. They offer a high degree of independence in terms of cooking and lifestyle, with private kitchen and bathroom facilities, rather than shared ones. This increased privacy and freedom make them stand out for those who desire more autonomy within a university-managed setting, directly addressing question 18. Like our halls, all utility bills are included in the rent.

Then there's Option G: University Managed Studios. These are self-contained studio apartments, ideal for individual postgraduate students or mature students who need their own private, quiet space to focus on their studies. They come with a private kitchenette and bathroom, offering complete independence, but still with the security and convenience of being university-managed. This option is particularly suited for individual postgraduate students needing private, quiet space, aligning with question 15. Again, all bills are included in the rental price.

Now, let's look at options outside of direct university management.

Option D is Private Rented Accommodation. This refers to houses or flats rented from private landlords or letting agencies. This is often the most cost-effective option for a group of students who want to live together, as you can split the rent and bills. This means it can be the most cost-effective option for a group of students, relating to question 14. However, it requires students to independently manage their tenancy agreements, including signing contracts, arranging deposits, and dealing directly with landlords. You'll also be responsible for setting up and paying for your own utility bills, such as electricity, gas, and internet. So, this option requires you to independently manage your tenancy and bills, which answers question 16.

Next, we have Option E: Homestay Accommodation. This involves living with a local family in their home. It's an excellent way to immerse yourself in local culture and, crucially, it provides an excellent chance for daily English language practice. Many homestay arrangements include meals, further simplifying your transition. It's often chosen by international students keen to improve their language skills and experience family life in the UK, making it a great choice for question 13.

Finally, for short-term needs, we offer Option F: Short-term Guest Accommodation. This is available in university guest rooms or temporary university apartments, primarily designed for very short stays, perhaps for students arriving early, attending pre-sessional courses, or needing a temporary base while they look for permanent accommodation. It's best for very short stays before finding a permanent place, addressing question 20. It's flexible but generally more expensive per night than long-term options.

I hope this overview has been helpful. We encourage you to visit our website for more detailed information and to explore the application process for university-managed housing. Thank you.

Part Part 3
Narrator: You will hear a tutor, Dr. Evans, discussing examination registration issues with two students, Liam and Chloe.

Dr. Evans: Come in, Liam, Chloe. Have a seat. Right, what can I help you both with today? Liam, you emailed me about some registration queries, and Chloe, you mentioned something similar.

Chloe: Yes, thank you, Dr. Evans. My main issue, and it's quite pressing, is that I've completely missed the deadline for the upcoming examination registration. I feel terrible about it. I just... I don't know what to do.

Liam: And for me, Dr. Evans, it's a couple of things, really. Firstly, I've noticed a module clash on my preliminary timetable that wasn't there when I initially selected my options. And secondly, it seems I've been registered for a module, I think it's \"Advanced Statistics,\" that I definitely didn't choose. I chose \"Statistical Modelling,\" not \"Advanced Statistics.\" So I'm really concerned about that.

Dr. Evans: Hmm, I see. Okay, let's address these one by one. Chloe, regarding your missed deadline. This is a serious matter, but not entirely uncommon. The university has a very strict policy on late registrations, but there can be avenues for resolution. My immediate advice for you would be to contact the examinations office directly, and I mean *immediately*. Don't delay another moment. Explain your situation clearly and politely. You might also need to complete a late registration form, which they can provide. It's crucial you act fast.

Chloe: Oh, okay. So, not my personal tutor or the student support office first, but the examinations office? Got it. I just feel so stupid. I received an email a few weeks ago outlining the process, but honestly, I just skimmed it, and I thought the deadline was for *final* confirmation after a pre-registration stage. I completely misunderstood the instructions. I was also dealing with some personal issues at home, which probably didn't help my concentration, but that's no excuse, really.

Dr. Evans: That's understandable, Chloe. The emails can sometimes be quite dense with information. It's a common pitfall. As for the online system itself, I've always found it to be generally efficient once you get the hang of it, but it does require careful attention to detail. I wouldn't say it's outdated, per se, but perhaps it could be more intuitive, especially for first-time users. It certainly isn't always straightforward. Some students find it quite confusing, which leads to these kinds of errors. I think it could benefit from a clearer, more streamlined user interface, to be honest. But it does work, when used correctly.

Liam: So, for me, Dr. Evans, about the module clash and the incorrect module. What's the process there? Do I just email the department?

Dr. Evans: For the module discrepancy, Liam, that's something different. If you've been registered for the wrong module, the first thing you need to do is go to the departmental office – specifically the one responsible for the module you *should* be taking. They'll have a change of module form that you'll need to complete and get signed. Make sure you bring proof of your initial selection, if you have it. You'll then need to submit that form back to them, and they'll liaise with the central administration. As for the timetable clash, once the incorrect module is rectified, that should resolve itself. If not, we can look at it again.

Liam: Right, the departmental office, with a form. Got it. And just a quick, separate question about exams, Dr. Evans. If, heaven forbid, I fail a module, how does the resit registration work?

Dr. Evans: Good question, Liam. For resit examinations, the university typically handles the registration automatically once the results are published and confirmed. You won't usually need to do anything proactively; you'll be informed of the resit dates and times. However, it's always wise to double-check your student portal once results are out, just to be sure. But no, you don't generally need to apply for them separately.

Chloe: That's good to know. It's all so much to keep track of.

Dr. Evans: Indeed it is. That brings me to my general advice for both of you for future registration periods. The most critical thing is to regularly check the university portal and your university email for all announcements. Set reminders on your phone for key deadlines. Don't rely solely on one communication channel or assume deadlines are flexible. Proactiveness is key. And if you're ever unsure about anything, absolutely contact the relevant office *before* a deadline passes. Don't wait until it's too late.

Liam: So, essentially, keep an eye on everything and don't hesitate to ask for help.

Dr. Evans: Exactly, Liam. My main message here, the crucial takeaway, is that while the university provides support and guidance, ultimately, students are responsible for managing their own academic registration process. It's a vital part of being a university student, and understanding these procedures will save you a lot of stress in the long run. Don't leave things to the last minute, and always seek clarification if something isn't clear. Does that make sense?

Chloe: Yes, Dr. Evans, it does. Thank you so much. I'll call the examinations office straight away.

Liam: And I'll head to the department office this afternoon. Thanks for your help, Dr. Evans.

Dr. Evans: You're most welcome. Good luck, both of you. And remember that advice for next time. It's better to be overly cautious than to face these kinds of issues.

Part Part 4
Narrator: You will hear a lecturer discussing the complexities of university course enrolment.

Narrator: You now have some time to look at questions 31 to 40.

Narrator: Now listen carefully and answer questions 31 to 40.

Speaker: Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture delves into a topic that is both fundamental and frequently misunderstood by students: the intricate process of university course enrolment. Far from being a mere administrative formality, choosing your courses is a critical academic exercise that shapes your entire university experience and subsequent professional trajectory. It's a task that, while seemingly straightforward, can present considerable hurdles, and indeed, many students find the process of course enrolment a significant 31 challenge. This often stems from the sheer volume of information, the rigid deadlines, and the sometimes opaque interdependencies between different units of study.

Navigating this landscape successfully requires a strategic approach. One of the primary areas where students encounter difficulty is in grasping the holistic framework of their chosen degree program. It is absolutely crucial to understand the overarching degree structure and, critically, all necessary 32 prerequisites before selecting individual units. Without this foundational understanding, students risk selecting units that do not contribute to their degree requirements, or worse, units for which they lack the foundational knowledge, leading to academic underperformance or delayed graduation. Each degree has a carefully curated pathway, and deviating from this without proper consultation can have serious consequences.

Another prevalent pitfall we observe is the tendency to gravitate towards courses based on superficial criteria. Students often make the mistake of prioritising a course's perceived 33 popularity, perhaps because many friends are taking it, or because it has a reputation for being 'easy'. While peer recommendations can offer some insight, they should never be the sole determinant. The focus should always be on the course's direct relevance to your academic goals, your personal intellectual interests, and how it aligns with your long-term career aspirations. What might be suitable for one student's pathway could be entirely counterproductive for another.

To mitigate these issues, we strongly advocate for proactive engagement with the university's support services. Early engagement with academic 34 advisors is highly recommended to clarify enrolment options, discuss degree progression, and explore potential specialisations. These advisors possess a wealth of institutional knowledge and can provide personalised guidance tailored to your specific academic profile and ambitions. They can help demystify the complex regulations and ensure you are making informed decisions, rather than relying on hearsay or incomplete information from peers.

Furthermore, given the competitive nature of some popular courses and the finite capacity of others, it is prudent to adopt a contingency planning mindset. To avoid disappointment, students should always have a 35 backup selection of courses in mind. This might involve identifying alternative units that fulfill similar requirements or exploring different elective options. This pragmatic approach ensures that even if your first choice is unavailable due to oversubscription or timetable clashes, you have viable alternatives ready, preventing unnecessary stress and delays in your enrolment process.

In recent years, the university has invested significantly in enhancing the digital infrastructure for course management. The university's online enrolment system, 'Unitrax', for example, has been designed to provide greater 36 flexibility to students during registration. This platform allows for real-time updates on course availability, direct access to unit descriptions, and the ability to modify your enrolment within specified periods. While it empowers students with autonomy, it also places a greater onus on them to carefully review their selections and understand the implications of their choices.

However, this flexibility is not without its boundaries. It is absolutely imperative that students familiarise themselves with the administrative timetable. Students must pay close attention to the published 37 deadlines for adding or dropping courses to avoid penalties. Missing these deadlines can result in financial charges, academic transcript notations for withdrawn courses, or even being locked into a course that no longer aligns with your academic plan. These deadlines are strictly enforced, and appeals are rarely granted, so mark them clearly in your calendar.

Let me reiterate a point about peer influence. While community and social interaction are vital aspects of university life, letting them dictate your academic choices is often detrimental. Choosing courses based solely on a friend's recommendation is a common 38 error that can lead to significant dissatisfaction later. Your academic journey is personal, and what excites or challenges your friend may not do the same for you. Reflect on your own strengths, weaknesses, and genuine interests before committing to any unit of study.

Looking beyond the immediate semester, students should also consider the broader implications of their course choices. Consideration of future 39 careers is a key factor when making long-term course selections. Aligning your elective choices and specialisations with your professional aspirations can significantly enhance your employability post-graduation. Researching industry trends, employer expectations, and required skill sets can help guide these decisions, making your academic profile more robust and appealing to potential employers.

In conclusion, successful course enrolment is not a passive activity but an active, iterative process. It requires careful 40 planning and proactive problem-solving. By understanding your degree requirements, engaging with academic advisors, considering backup options, adhering to deadlines, and making choices that align with your personal and professional goals, you can navigate the enrolment period with confidence and set yourself up for academic success. Remember, your choices now pave the way for your future. Thank you.
