A couple of announcements for art-lovers and budding artists alike. First, a new collection of artwork is going on show to the public next month in the form of an artists' exhibition. The exhibition will include many different types of art, over 100 different pieces, by 58 artists from the local area. It's being held at the Royal Museum [11] which - for those of you who are unfamiliar with the area - is located opposite the library in West Street, right on the corner. The actual address is number 1, Queen's Park Road [12] - it isn't difficult to find. The exhibition will run for 9 weeks and will begin on the 6th of October and continue until the 10th December [13]. So there's plenty of time for you to go along and have a look and I'm sure that will be worth doing.\\nWhat will you see there? Well, amongst the items on display will be some exciting pieces of modern jewellery, furniture, ceramics, metal work [14] and sculpture. To give you some examples, local artist Kate Maine will be there to discuss her collection of pots and bowls that she has made to resemble garden vegetables. They're the sort of thing that would brighten up any dining table, and range from things like yellow cabbage-shaped bowls to round tomato-shaped teapots [15 - note that the word 'vegetable' is not mentioned, but cabbage and tomato are both vegetables]. Prize-winner Cynthia Course will also be there to talk about her silver jewellery, all of which she produced using ideas from the rural setting of her country home. Some of her rings are quite extraordinary and have beautiful coloured stones [16] in them. Or if you prefer sculpture, there's plenty of that too. Take, for example, Susan Cup's sculpture of 25 pairs of white paper shoes [17]. It sounds easy, but believe me it looks incredible! All of these items along with many others will be on sale-throughout the exhibition period.\\nAs part of the exhibition, there will be a series of demonstrations called 'Face to Face' [18 — remember to capitalise the answer — it is a name of an exhibition] which will take place every Sunday afternoon during the exhibition and these will provide an opportunity for you to meet the artists.\\nThe second set of activities are for those who would prefer to indulge in some artwork themselves, the Artist's Conservatory are holding a series of courses over the autumn period. The courses cover all media and include subjects such as Chinese brush painting, pencil drawing [19] and silk painting. All the tutors are experienced artists, course sizes are kept to a minimum of 15 and there will be plenty of individual assistance.\\nAll the sessions offer excellent value for money and the opportunity to relax in a delightful rural setting. Fees are very reasonable and include the use of an excellent studio and access to the art shop which you will find sells everything from paper to CDs and they also include the provision of all materials [20].

I know for instance that it's very hard to breed bears in captivity.\\nAlison: Yes, well, I think that by raising people's awareness generally we can reduce conflict between humans and animals, to stop the slaughter in parts of the world where bears are still hunted [29] — supposedly in self-defense or to protect livestock, but often quite unnecessarily. And we can also encourage governments to preserve the natural environment of the bear rather than allow the areas where they live to be systematically destroyed in the name of progress.\\nInterviewer: Yes, of course.\\nAlison: And in addition to these global efforts, all profits from the sale of my book will go towards the United Nations Bear Protection program [30].\", 'Question_Type': 'T005'}]}, 'Part 4': {'Subparts': [{'Questions': ['31 The speaker compares a solar eclipse today to a\\nA religious experience\\nB scientific event\\nC popular spectacle', '32 The speaker says that the dark spot of an eclipse is\\nA simple to predict\\nB easy to explain\\nC randomly occurring', '33 Concerning an eclipse, the ancient Chinese were\\nA fascinated\\nB rational\\nC terrified', '34 For the speaker, the most impressive aspect of an eclipse is the\\nA exceptional beauty of the sky\\nB chance for scientific study\\nC effect of the moon on the sun', '35 Eclipses occur rarely because of the size of the\\nA moon\\nB sun\\nC earth', '36 In predicting eclipses, the Babylonians were restricted by their\\nA religious attitudes\\nB inaccurate observations\\nC limited ability to calculate'], 'Answers': ['C', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'C'], 'Transcript': \"Man: Good evening and welcome to this month's Observatory Club lecture. I'm Donald Mackie and I'm here to talk to you about the solar eclipse in history.\\nA thousand years ago, a total eclipse of the sun was a terrifying religious experience - but these days an eclipse is more likely to be viewed as a tourist attraction [31] than as a scientific or spiritual event. People will travel literally miles to be in the right place at the right time — to get the best view of their eclipse.\\nWell. What exactly causes a solar eclipse — when the world goes dark for a few minutes in the middle of the day? Scientifically speaking, the dark spot itself is easy to explain [32]: it is the shadow of the moon streaking across the earth. This happens every year or two, each time along a different and, to all intents and purposes, a seemingly random piece of the globe.\\nIn the past people often interpreted an eclipse as a danger signal heralding disaster and in fact, the Chinese were so disturbed by these events that they included among their gods one whose job it was to prevent eclipses [33]. But whether or not you are superstitious or take a purely scientific view, our earthly eclipses are special in three ways.\\nFirstly, there can be no doubt that they are very beautiful. It's as if a deep blue curtain had fallen over the daytime sky as the sun becomes a black void surrounded by the glow of its outer atmosphere.\\nBut beyond this, total eclipses possess a second more compelling beauty in the eves of us scientists, for they offer a unique opportunity for research [34]. Only during an eclipse can we study the corona and other dim things that are normally lost in the sun's glare.\\nAnd thirdly, they are rare. Even though an eclipse of the sun occurs somewhere on earth every year or two, if you sit in your garden and wait, it will take 375 years on average for one to come to you. If the moon were any larger, eclipses would become a monthly bore [35]: if it were smaller, they simply would not be possible.\\nThe ancient Babylonian priests, who spent a fair bit of time staring at the sky, had already noted that there was an 18-year pattern in their recurrence but they didn't have the mathematics to predict an eclipse accurately [36].\", 'Question_Type': 'T007'}, {'Questions': ['Date of \\neclipse\\nScientists\\nObservation\\n1715\\nHalley\\n37 __________ who accurately predicted an eclipse', 'Date of \\neclipse\\nScientists\\nObservation\\n1868\\nJanssen and Lockyer\\nDiscovered 38 __________', 'Date of \\neclipse\\nScientists\\nObservation\\n1878\\nWatson\\nBelieved he had found 39 __________', 'Date of \\neclipse\\nScientists\\nObservation\\n1919\\nEinstein\\nRealised astronomers had misunderstood 40 \\n__________'], 'Answers': ['first person', '(a)new element/helium', '(the) lost planet/(the) new planet/Vulcan', 'gravity'], 'Transcript': \"It was Edmund Halley, the English astronomer, who knew his maths well enough to predict the return of the comet which, incidentally bears his name, and in 1715 he became the first person to make an accurate eclipse prediction [37].\\nThis brought eclipses firmly into the scientific domain and they have since allowed a number of important scientific discoveries to be made. For instance, in the eclipse of 1868 two scientists, Janssen and Lockyer, were observing the sun's atmosphere and it was these observations that ultimately led to the discovery of a new element [38]. They named the element helium after the Greek god of the sun. This was a major find, because helium turned out to be the most common element in the universe after hydrogen. Another great triumph involved Mercury. I'll just put that up on the board for you now. See — there's Mercury — the planet closest to the Sun - then Venus, Earth, etc. For centuries, scientists had been unable to understand why Mercury appeared to rotate faster than it should. Some astronomers suggested that there might be an undiscovered planet causing this unusual orbit and even gave it the name 'Vulcan'. During the eclipse of 1878, an American astronomer, James Watson, thought he had spotted this so-called 'lost' planet [39]. But, alas for him, he was later obliged to admit that he had been wrong about Vulcan and withdrew his claim.\\nThen Albert Einstein came on the scene. Einstein suggested that rather than being wrong about the number of planets, astronomers were actually wrong about gravity [40]. Einstein's theory of relativity - for which he is so famous - disagreed with Newton's law of gravity in just the right way to explain Mercury's odd orbit. He also realised that a definitive test would be possible during the total eclipse of 1919 and this is indeed when his theory was finally proved correct.\", 'Question_Type': 'T001'}]}}\n",

The top is made of glass so that you can look \\ndown into it.\\nProfessor: And there’s a stone at the bottom. Is that just for decoration?\\nJohn: Actually it does have a function. Instead of pushing a button, you turn the stone [23].\\nProfessor: So it’s really just a novel way of starting the dishwasher [23].\\nJohn: That's right.\\nProfessor: It’s a really nice design, but what makes it innovative?\\nJohn: Well, I decided to make a dishwasher that uses carbon dioxide.\\nProfessor: In place of water and detergent? How will you manage that?\\nJohn: The idea is to pressurise the carbon dioxide so that it becomes a liquid. The fluid is then released into the \\ndishwasher where it cleans the dishes all by itself.\\nProfessor: Sounds like a brilliant idea! Your system will totally do away with the need for strong detergents. So what \\nhappens once the dishes are clean?\\nJohn: Well, to allow them to dry, the liquid carbon dioxide and the waste materials all go to an area called the holding \\nchamber. That's where the liquid is depressurised and so it reverts to a gas [24]. Then the oil and grease are separated out \\nand sent to the waste system.\\nProfessor: It sounds like you’ve thought it all out very thoroughly. So, what happens to the carbon dioxide once the \\nprocess is complete? Not wasted I hope.\\nJohn: Actually, that’s where the real savings are made. The carbon dioxide is sent back to the cylinder and can be used \\nagain and again [25].\\nProfessor: What a terrific idea. Do you think it will ever be built?\\nJohn: Probably not, but that’s OK.\\nProfessor: Well, I'm sure a lot of positive things will come out of your design.\", 'Question_Type': 'T007'}, {'Questions': ['• John needs help preparing for his 26 ________ .', '• The professor advises John to make a 27 ________ of his design.', '• John’s main problem is getting good quality 28 ________ .', '• The professor suggests John apply for a 29 ________ .', '• The professor will check the 30 ________ information in John’s written\\nreport.'], 'Answers': ['presentation', 'model', 'material/materials', 'grant', 'technical'], 'Transcript': \"Professor: Now, you seem to have thought about everything so what exactly did you need me to help you with?\\nJohn: Well, my design has made it to the final stage of the competition and, in a few months’ time, I have to give a \\npresentation, and that's the part I was hoping you could help me with [26].\\nProfessor: Right, well that should be easy enough.

One in ten black bears is actually born with a white coat, which is the result of a special gene that \\nsurfaces in a few [31]. Local people have named it ‘the spirit bear'. And according to the legends of these communities, \\nits snowy fur brings with it a special power [32]. Because of this, it has always been highly regarded by them - so much \\nthat they do not speak of seeing it to anyone else. It is their way of protecting it when strangers visit the area [33].\\nThe white bear’s habitat is quite interesting. The bear’s strong relationship with the old- growth rainforest is a complex \\none. The white bear relies on the huge centuries-old trees in the forest in many ways. For example, the old-growth trees \\nhave extremely long roots that help prevent erosion of the soil along the banks of the many fish streams [34]. Keeping \\nthese banks intact is important because these streams are home to salmon, which are the bear’s main food source. In \\nreturn, the bear’s feeding habits nurture the forest. As the bears eat the salmon, they discard the skin and bones in great \\namounts on the forest floor, which provide vital nutrients. These produce lush vegetation that sustains thousands of other \\ntypes of life forms, from birds to insects and more.\\nToday, the spirit bear lives off the coast of the province of British Columbia on a few islands [35]. There is great concern \\nfor their survival since it is estimated that less than two hundred of these white bears remain. The best way to protect \\nthem is to make every effort to preserve the delicate balance of their forest environment - in other words, their \\necosystem.\\nThe greatest threat to the bear’s existence is the loss of its habitat. Over many years, logging companies have stripped the\\nland by cutting down a large number of trees. In addition, they have built roads which have fractured the areas where the \\nbear usually feeds [36], and many hibernation sites have also been lost . The logging of the trees along the streams has \\ndamaged the places where the bears fish. To make matters worse, the number of salmon in those streams is declining \\nbecause there is no legal limit on fishing [37] at the moment.\\nAll these influences have a negative impact on the spirit bear’s very existence, which is made all the more fragile by the \\nfact that reproduction among these bears has always been disappointingly low [38].\\nAnd so, what's the situation going forward? Community organisations, environmental groups and the British Columbia \\ngovernment are now working together on the problem.\\nThe government is now requiring logging companies to adopt a better logging method [39], which is a positive step. \\nHowever, these measures alone may not be sufficient to ensure a healthy population of the spirit bear in the future.\\nOther steps also need to be taken. While it is important to maintain the spirit bear’s habitat, there also needs to be more \\nemphasis on its expansion [40]. The move is justified as it will also create space for other bears that are losing their \\nhomes...\", 'Question_Type': 'T011'}]}}\n",

I’m very pleased to have this opportunity to say a little about two exciting new developments in the city: the Brackenside Open-Air Swimming Pool and the children’s Adventure Playground in Central Park. As many of you may know, the idea for these initiatives came from you, the public [11], in the extensive consultation exercise which the City Council conducted last year. And they have been realised using money from the SWRDC - the South West Regional Development Commission. First of all, Brackenside Pool. As many of the older members of the audience will remember, there used to be a wonderful open-air pool on the sea front 30 years ago but it had to close when it was judged to be unsafe. For the design of this new heated pool, we were very happy to secure the talents of internationally renowned architect Ellen Wendon, who has managed to combine a charming 1930s design, which fits in so well with many of the other buildings in the area, with up-to-the-minute features such as a recycling system - the only one of its kind in the world - which enables seawater to be used in the pool [12]. Now, there has been quite a bit of discussion in the local press about whether there would be enough room for the number of visitors we’re hoping to attract [13], but the design is deceptive and there have been rigorous checks about capacity. Also, just in case you were wondering, we’re on schedule for a June 15th opening date and well within budget: a testimony to the excellent work of local contractors Hickman’s. We hope that as many people as possible will be there on June 15th. We have engaged award winning actress Coral White to declare the pool open and there’ll be drinks and snacks available at the pool side.

The unique design is based on the concept of the Global Village, with the playground being divided into six areas showing different parts of the world - each with a representative feature. For example, there is a section on Asia, and this is represented by rides and equipment in the shape of snakes, orangutans, tigers and so on - fauna native to the forests of the region. [15] Moving south to the Antarctic - we couldn’t run to an ice rink I’m afraid but opted instead for climbing blocks in the shape of mountains [16] - I thought they could have had slides for the glaciers but the designers did want to avoid being too literal! Then on to South America - and here the theme is El Dorado - games replicating the search for mines full of precious stones [17]. And then moving up to North America, here there was considerable debate, I know the contribution of cinema and jazz was considered but the designers finally opted for rockets and the International Space Station [18]. Eastwards to Europe then, and perhaps the most traditional choice of all the areas: medieval castles and other fortifications [19]. Then last, but not least, moving south to Africa and a whole set of wonderful mosaics to represent the great rivers [20] of this fascinating and varied continent.

I think you should finish with that. Victor: OK. Olivia: All right, Victor, so after your part I’ll talk about Thor Heyerdahl’s adult life, continuing from the theory he had about Polynesian migration. Up until that time of course, academics had believed that humans first migrated to the islands in Polynesia from Asia, in the west. Victor: Yes, they thought that travel from the east was impossible, because of the huge, empty stretch of ocean that lies between the islands and the nearest inhabited land[25]. Olivia: Yes, but Heyerdahl spent ages studying the cloud movements, ocean currents and wind patterns to find if it was actually possible. And another communities lying to the east of Polynesia. But Heyerdahl knew they made lots of coastal voyages in locally built canoes. Victor: Yes, or sailing on rafts, as was shown by the long voyage that Heyerdahl did next. It was an incredibly risky journey to undertake - sometimes I wonder if he did that trip for private reasons, you know? To show others that he could\\nhave spectacular adventures. What do you think, Olivia? Olivia: Well, I think it was more a matter of simply trying out his idea, to see if migration from the east was possible. Victor: Yes, that's probably it [26]. And the poor guy suffered a bit at that time because the war forced him to stop his work for some years... Olivia: Yes. When he got started again and planned his epic voyage, do you think it was important to him that he achieve\\nit before anyone else did? Victor: Uhm, I haven’t read anywhere that that was his motivation. The most important factor seems to have been that he\\nuse only ancient techniques and local materials to build his raft [27]. Olivia: Yes. I wonder how fast it went. Victor: Well, it took them 97 days from South America to the Pacific Islands. Olivia: Mm. And after that, Heyerdahl went to Easter Island, didn't he? We should mention the purpose of that trip. I \\nthink he sailed there in a boat made out of reeds. Victor: No, that was later on in Egypt, Olivia. Olivia: Oh, yes, that’s right. Victor: But what he wanted to do was talk to the local people about their old stone carvings and then make one himself \\nto learn more about the process[28]. Olivia: I see. Well, what a great life. Even though many of his theories have been disproven, he certainly left a lasting \\nimpression on many disciplines, didn’t he? To my mind, he was the first person to establish what modern academics call \\npractical archaeology. I mean, that they try to recreate something from the past today , like he did with his raft trip[29]. \\nIt’s unfortunate that his ideas about where Polynesians originated from have been completely discredited. Victor: Yes. Right, well, I'll prepare a PowerPoint slide at the end that acknowledges our sources. I mainly used The Life\\nand Work of Thor Heyerdahl by William Oliver. I thought the research methods he used were very sound, although I \\nmust say I found the overall tone somewhat old-fashioned. I think they need to do a new, revised edition[30]. Olivia: Yeah, I agree. What about the subject matter - I found it really challenging! Victor: Well, it's a complex issue... Olivia: I thought the book had lots of good points.

And what I'm going to present in this seminar is a few ideas about how the activity is likely to change in \\nthe next ten years. It isn't a scientific, statistical analysis - just some ideas for us to discuss. One area I want to mention is business markets, and I’m sure a really significant development will be a major increase in \\ncompetition [31], with companies from all round the world trying to sell similar products. Consumers will have much more choice - for instance, food products sold in Australia might be manufactured in the \\nUSA, China, Finland and dozens of other countries. At the same time, mergers and takeovers mean that governments are \\nactually losing power to major global corporations [32]. We can probably all think of companies that exert a great deal of influence, which may be good for consumers. A third point I want to make about markets is that in the rapidly expanding economies, such as India, China, Brazil and \\nRussia, demand is growing very fast [33]. This is putting pressure on resources all over the world. I think businesses are becoming more open to external \\ninfluences. In particular, companies are consulting customers more and more before making their business decisions \\n[34]. Companies are finding out what they want and providing it, instead of making products and then trying to sell them,\\nwhich is the model of years ago. Another influence is that concerns about the environment will force manufacturers to extend product, life cycles, to \\nreduce the amount of pollution and waste. And in some cases, regulation will need to be strengthened [35]. Many societies are much more fluid and democratic, and the structure of companies is changing to reflect that. I think \\nwe're going to see a greater emphasis within companies on teams created with a specific project in mind [36]. And when \\nthey're completed, the teams will be disbanded and new ones formed. More and more people see work as simply one part of their lifestyle, and not the most important one, and as the \\nworkforce is shrinking in some countries, businesses are having to compete for staff instead of being able to choose \\namong a lot of applicants. Typical examples that will attract and retain staff are traditional ones like flexible hours and - \\nsomething that has been made possible by advances in technology - remote working [37], with people based at their \\nhome, abroad, or almost anywhere they choose. Management styles will almost certainly continue to change. Senior managers will require a lot more than the efficiency \\nthat they’ve always needed. Above all they'll need great skills in leadership [38], so that their organisation can initiate \\nand respond to change in a fast-moving world, where they face lots of competing requirements and potential conflicts. In most of the world, the senior managers of large businesses are mainly men in their fifties and sixties. The predominant\\nstyle of management will almost certainly become more consultative and collaborative, caused above all, by more \\nwomen moving into senior management positions [39]. Many of the changes are influenced by developments in the wider economy. The traditional emphasis of business was \\nmanufacturing, and of course the service sector is very important. But we shouldn’t overlook the growing financial \\ncontribution of IP, that is, intellectual property. Some books and films generate enormous sums from the sale of related \\nDVDs, music, games, clothes, and so on. Another point I’d like to make is that although I’ve been talking about companies, one trend that they have to face is the \\nmove away from people working for the same employer for years. Instead, more and more people are becoming self-\\nemployed [40], to gain the freedom and control over their lives that they’re unlikely to get from being employed.\", 'Question_Type': 'T010'}]}}\n",

Welcome to the Early Learning Childcare Centre. How may I help you?\\nCaller: Hi. I spoke to you last week about enrolling my daughter for next year.\\nR: Oh, yes. I’ll just get some details from you. So, you're her mother?\\nC: That’s right.\\nR: And, can I have your name?\\nC: It’s Carol, Carol Smith.\\nR: And your daughter’s name?\\nC: It's Kate.\\nR: Now, we have several groups at the centre and we cater for children from three to five years old. How old is your \\ndaughter?\\nC: She’s three now but she turns four next month.\\nR: I’ll put four down because that's how old she'll be when she starts. [1]\\nC: Fine, she’s so excited about her birthday and coming to the centre.\\nR: That’s good to hear. And what's your address?\\nC: It’s 46 Wombat Road, that's W-O-M-B-A-T [2], Woodside 4032.\\nR: And what’s the phone number?\\nhttps://engexam.info/ielts-listening-practice-tests-printable/ – printable IELTS Listening tests \\nPage 5\\nIELTS Listening – Practice Test 3\\nC: Oh... it’s... 3345 9865.\\nR: So, have you decided on the days you’d like to bring your daughter here?\\nC: I’d prefer Monday and Wednesday if possible.\\nR: Hmm. I'll check, Monday’s fine, but I think the centre is already full for Wednesday. Uhm. Yes. Sorry. It seems to be a\\nvery popular day. We can offer you a Thursday or a Friday as well.\\nC: Oh dear. I suppose Thursday would be all right [3] because she has swimming on Friday.\\nR: OK, got that. Because a lot of parents work, we do offer flexible start and finish times. We are open from 7:30 in the \\nmorning until 6 o'clock at night.\\nWhat time would you like your daughter to start?\\nC: I need to get to work in the city by 9:00 so I'll drop her off at 8:30 [4]. You’re pretty close to the city here so that \\nshould give me plenty of time to get there.\\nR: That’s fine. Now, we also need to decide which group she'll be in. We have two different groups and they’re divided \\nup according to age. There’s the green group, which is for three to four-year-olds. And then there’s the red group which is\\nfor four- to five-year-olds.\\nC: She’s quite mature for her age and she can already write her name and read a little.\\nR: Well, I’ll put her in the red group [5] and we can always change her to the green one if there are any problems.\\nC: That sounds fine.\\nR: OK. Let's move on to meals. We can provide breakfast, lunch and dinner. As she’s finishing pretty early, she won't \\nneed dinner, will you give her breakfast before she comes?\\nC: Yes, she'll only need lunch. [6]\\nR: Now, does she have any medical conditions we need to know about? Does she have asthma or any hearing problems \\nfor example?\\nC: No. But she does need to wear glasses. [7]\\nR: Oh, I'll make a note of that.\\nC: Yes, she's pretty good about wearing them, she can’t see much without them.\\nR: Right. OK. Now, I also need emergency contact details.\\nC: So what sort of information do you need?\\nR: Just the name and number of a friend or family member we can contact in case we can’t get hold of you at any time.\\nC: That’d better be my sister... Jenny Ball . That’s B-A-double L [8]. Her phone number is 3346 7523.\\nR: Great. So she is the child's aunt?\\nC: Yes, that’s right. [9]\\nR: I’ll make a note of that as well. Now, is there anything you’d like to ask?\\nC: What about payment? How much are the fees each term?\\nR: Well, for two days and the hours you’ve chosen, that will be $450 altogether.\\nC: OK, and do I have lo pay that now?\\nR: No, we send out invoices once the children start at the centre. You can choose to pay at the end of each term or we do \\noffer a slightly discounted rate if you pay every month.\\nC: Oh. I’ll do that then . I find it easier to budget that way and I’m not used to the term dates just yet. [10]\\nR: Good, it makes it a lot simpler for us as well.

Self-regulatory focus theory is a theory developed by Tory Higgins. He says that a person’s\\nfocus at any given time is to either approach pleasure or avoid pain. These are two basic motivations that each and every \\none of us has, and they cause us to have different kinds of goals. Promotion goals in different life situations emphasise \\nachievement [31]. Prevention goals are oriented towards the avoidance of punishment.\\nIn a specific situation, our thoughts might focus more on promotion goals or more on prevention goals. The theory \\nsuggests that two factors affect which goals we are focusing on. First, there is a chronic factor. This factor is connected to\\na person\\'s personality [32] and says that each person has a basic tendency to either focus more on promotion goals or \\nfocus more on prevention goals as part of his or her personality. Second, there is a situational factor [33] which means \\nthat the context we are in can make us more likely to focus on one set of goals or the other. For example, we are more \\nlikely to be thinking about pleasure and to have promotion goals when we are spending time with a friend [34]. In \\ncontrast, if we are working on an important project for our boss, we are more likely to try to avoid making mistakes and \\ntherefore have more prevention goals in our mind.\\nResearch has shown that the goals we are focusing on at a given time affect the way we think. For example, when \\nfocusing on promotion goals, people consider their ideal self, their aspirations and gains [35]. They don\\'t think about \\nwhat they can lose, so they think in a happier mode. They feel more inspired to change. When people are focusing on \\nprevention goals, they think about their “ought\" self. What are they supposed to be? What are people expecting from \\nthem? They consider their obligations to others. As a result, they experience more anxiety and try to avoid situations \\nwhere they could lose.\\nNow that I have talked about the two focuses and how they affect people, I want to look at the idea that the way leaders \\nbehave, or their style of leading, can affect the focus [36] that followers adopt in a specific situation.\\nIn talking about leadership, we often mention transformational leaders and transactional leaders. Transformational \\nleaders, when interacting with their followers, focus on their development [37]. In their words and actions \\ntransformational leaders highlight change. Their speech is passionate and conveys a definitive vision [38]. All of these \\nthings can encourage followers to think about what could be. In other words, they inspire a promotion focus in their \\nfollowers.\\nhttps://engexam.info/ielts-listening-practice-tests-printable/ – printable IELTS Listening tests \\nPage 9\\nIELTS Listening – Practice Test 3\\nIn contrast, transactional leaders focus on developing clear structures that tell their followers exactly what is expected of \\nthem [39]. While they do explain the rewards people will get for following orders, they emphasise more how a follower \\nwill be punished or that a follower won\\'t get rewarded if his or her behaviour doesn’t change. In short, they emphasise \\nthe consequences of making a mistake. This emphasis will clearly lead followers to focus on avoiding punishment and \\nproblems. This is clearly a prevention focus.\\nIn conclusion, it is important to understand that one focus is not necessarily better than the other one. For a designer who \\nworks in a field where a lot of innovation is needed, a promotion focus is probably better [40]. In contrast, a prevention \\nfocus which causes people to work more cautiously and produce higher quality work might be very appropriate for a job \\nlike a surgeon, for example. The main point of the research, though, is that the actions of leaders can greatly influence \\nwhether people approach a situation with more of a promotion focus or more of a prevention focus.\\nhttps://engexam.info/ielts-listening-practice-tests-printable/ – printable IELTS Listening tests \\nPage 10', 'Question_Type': 'T010'}]}}\n",

But, as demand grew, the smelting process required huge factory furnaces or fires to melt the metal from the rock and there was not enough coal in the local area, so the rocks containing minerals had to be shipped long distances [13].\\nSadly, in the twentieth century, the great port of Manham declined, and thousands of workers were forced to emigrate out of the area [14]. The building at the port fell into disrepair, and the place became almost forgotten. But then, the Manham Trust was formed to conserve the historical resources of the area. It organised scores of local volunteers to remove undergrowth to find the original outlines of the installations. It then brought in paid professionals to match installations with maps of the original port complex and to set about reconstructing it [15].', 'Question_Type': 'T007'}, {'Questions': [\"copper mine\\nSpecially adapted miners' 16_____ take \\nvisitors into the mountain\", 'the mine is 17 _____ and enclosed — unsuitable \\nfor children and animals', 'village school\\nclassrooms and a special exhibition of 18 \\n_____', 'a 19 _____ is recommended', '\"The George\" (old \\nsailing ship)\\nthe ship\\'s wheel (was lost but has now been \\nrestored)\\nchildren shouldn\\'t use the 20 _____'], 'Answers': ['trains', 'dark', 'games', 'guided tour', 'ladder/ladders'], 'Transcript': \"But what can you do and see on your visit today?

Some scientists recommend that nano-particles be treated as new chemicals with separate safety tests and clear labelling [32].\\nThey believe that greater care should also be taken with nano-particles in laboratories and factories [32].

Those same improved capabilities will dramatically reduce the cost of travelling into space making it more accessible to ordinary people [35] and opening up a totally new holiday destination.\\nIn terms of technology, the computer industry will be able to shrink computer parts down to minute sizes. We need nanotechnology in order to create a new generation of computers that will work even faster and will have a million times more memory [36] but will be about the size of a sugar cube.\\nNanotechnology could also revolutionise the way that we generate power. The cost of solar cells will be drastically reduced so harnessing this energy will be far more economical [37] than at present.\\nBut nanotechnology has much wider applications than this and could have an enormous impact on our environment. For instance, tiny airborne nano-robots could be programmed to actually rebuild the ozone layer, which could lessen the impact of global warming on our planet. That’s a pretty amazing thought, isn’t it? On a more local scale, this new technology could help with the clean-up of environmental disasters as nanotechnology will allow us to remove oil and other contaminants from the water far more effectively [38]. And, if nanotechnology progresses as expected - as a sort of building block set of about 90 atoms - then you could build anything you wanted from the bottom up. In terms of production, this means that you only use what you need and so there wouldn't be any waste [39].\\nThe notion that you could create anything at all has major implications for our health. It means that we’ll eventually be able to replicate anything. This would have a phenomenal effect on our society. In time it could even lead to the eradication of famine through the introduction of machines that produce food to feed the hungry.\\nBut it’s in the area of medicine that nanotechnology may have its biggest impact.

How many were there? Well, only 473 Duesenberg J-types were ever built [11] and the model here is one of the rarest.\\nEach had a short 125-inch chassis or framework and the body was always in the form of an open two-seater [12] .\\nThe technology behind the car's 6.9-litre engine was extraordinary. It featured capsules of mercury in the engines to absorb vibration and provide an incredibly smooth ride [13].\\nIn fact, these cars offered unparalleled performance, in an age when 160 kilometres per hour was considered very fast, the Duesenberg promised a top speed of 180 kilometres per hour [14] and could do 140 kilometres per hour in second gear.\\nDuesenberg, who designed the car, sold it as a frame and engine [15] ... this was typical of the age again and many prestige manufacturers such as Rolls-Royce did exactly the same. Owners able to afford the hefty $9,000 price tag for the basic car would then commission a coachwork company to build a body tailored to their own individual requirements.\\nThe Duesenberg's great attraction for the driver was its instrument panel which offered all the usual features but also several others including a stop-watch [16].\\nIt was the Duesenberg's technology that lay behind its success as a racing car and they dominated the American racing scene in the 1920s winning the Indianapolis Grand Prix in 1924, '25 and '27.\\nOn to another celebrity, the 1922 Leyat Helica. Only 30 of these French propeller cars were built [17] and the model here at Goodwood, which was the fourth to be made, is thought to be the only surviving example still capable of running.\\nThe brains behind this car was Marcel Leyat who was an aviation pioneer first and foremost, and the influence of flying is quite apparent in the car. The Leyat very strongly resembles a light aircraft [18] with its front propeller but in this case it's minus any wings [19] of course!\\nIt's quite odd to think that this car was whirring through France, just as the Duesenberg was blasting down roads at 160 kilometres per hour across the Atlantic. The Leyats were used regularly in France in the 1920s and were even produced in saloon and van form, as well as two-seater. The Leyat matched its propeller drive with its equally bizarre steering which used the rear rather than the front wheels [20]! But despite looking rather frail, it was a tough machine. In fact, when troops tried to steal it during the Second World War, the car's baffling design was clearly beyond the would-be thieves and it ended up being driven into a tree, breaking the propeller.\", 'Question_Type': 'T011'}]}, 'Part 3': {'Subparts': [{'Questions': ['Research details:\\nTitle of project: 21 __________\\nFocus of project: entertainment away from 22 __________'], 'Answers': ['Out and About', '(the) university/campus'], 'Transcript': \"Rosie: Yes, well, urn, we've done a survey on local entertainment.

So, when we interviewed the students, we thought the Complex would be the most popular choice of cinema ... but surprisingly it was the late-night Odeon [24] .\\nMike: Yeah, and most students said that if they wanted to see a new film, they waited for it to show at the Park because the complex is more expensive and further out of town so you have to pay more to get there as well.\\nTutor: Yes, and that adds to the cost, of course, and detracts from the popularity [24], evidently .\\nRosie: Well, next, we looked at theatres.

As you know, dust storms have always been a feature of desert climates, but what we want to focus on today is the extent to which human activity is causing them [31]. And it is this trend that I want to look at, because it has wide-ranging implications.\\nSo - what are these human activities ? Well, there are two main types that affect the wind erosion process, and thus the frequency of dust storms. There are activities that break up naturally wind-resistant surfaces such as off-road vehicle use and construction and there are those that remove protective vegetation cover from soils, for example, mainly farming and drainage. [32] In many cases the two effects occur simultaneously which adds to the problem.\", 'Question_Type': 'T011'}, {'Questions': [\"Complete the table using NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS AND/OR A NUMBER for each answer.\\nName of area\\nDetails\\nUSA 'dust bowl' Caused by mismanagement of farmland\\nDecade renamed the 33 __________\\nWest Africa\\nSteady rise in dust storms over 20-ear period\\nArizona\\nWorst dust clouds arise from 34 __________\\nDust deposits are hazardous to 35 __________\\nSahara\\nIncreased wind erosion has occurred along with long-term 36 __________\"], 'Answers': ['Dirty Thirties/30s', 'dry thunderstorms', 'machine operators', 'drought'], 'Transcript': \"Lecturer: Let's look at some real examples and see what I'm talking about. Perhaps the best-known example of agricultural impact on desert dust is the creation of the USA's 'dust bowl' in the 1930s. The dramatic rise in the number of dust storms during the latter part of that decade was the result of farmers mismanaging their land. In fact, choking dust storms became so commonplace that the decade became known as the 'Dirty Thirties'. [33]\\nResearchers observed a similar, but more prolonged, increase in dustiness in West Africa between the 1960s and the 1980s when the frequency of the storms rose to 80 a year and the dust was so thick that visibility was reduced to 1,0 metres. This was a hazard to pilots and road users.\\nIn places like Arizona, the most dangerous dust clouds are those generated by dry thunderstorms. [34] Here, this type of storm is so common that the problem inspired officials to develop an alert system to warn people of oncoming thunderstorms. When this dust is deposited it causes all sorts of problems for machine operators. [35] It can penetrate the smallest nooks and crannies and play havoc with the way things operate because most of the dust is made up of quartz which is very hard.\\nAnother example - the concentration of dust originating from the Sahara has risen steadily since the mid-1960s.\\nThis increase in wind erosion has coincided with a prolonged drought, [36] which has gripped the Sahara's southern fringe. Drought is commonly associated with an increase in dust-raising activity but it's actually caused by low rainfall which results in vegetation dying off.\", 'Question_Type': 'T011'}, {'Questions': [], 'Answers': ['irrigation', 'two-thirds', 'salty/saline/toxic', 'crops/plants/agriculture'], 'Transcript': \"Lecturer: One of the foremost examples of modern human-induced environmental degradation is the drying up of the Aral Sea in Central Asia. Its ecological demise dates from the 1950s when intensive irrigation began in the then Central Asian [37] republics of the USSR. This produced a dramatic decline in the volume of water entering the sea from its two major tributaries. In 1960, the Aral Sea was the fourth-largest lake in the world, but since that time it has lost two-thirds of its volume [38], its surface area has halved and its water level has dropped by more than 216 metres. A knock-on effect of this ecological disaster has been the release of significant new sources of wind-blown material, as the water level has dropped.\\nAnd the problems don't stop there. The salinity of the lake has increased [39] so that it is now virtually the same as sea water. This means that the material that is blown from the dry bed of the Aral Sea is highly saline. Scientists believe it is adversely affecting crops [40] around the sea because salts are toxic to plants.\", 'Question_Type': 'T011'}]}}\n",

This beach is one kilometre away from the old fishing village of Bandela [11], which is a beautiful spot. If you park in the car park behind it, there's a small path which leads down to the bay.

The land around this beach is marshland, it's all marsh [13], and there's a stream which winds through it and the stream goes into the sea, and the beach has lovely pale gold sand. Access to this beach is quite tricky and not for the less energetic! You have to go down a long flight of steps - 190 to be exact. But you'll be relieved to know that there's also a road which winds down to a car parking area. When you're level with the sea, there is a handful of shops and bars and you can hire sunbeds and umbrellas [14] . Continuing round the island, just past the Tip of Cain is the next beach I'd suggest you visit and this is San Gett. Why? Because there isn't a beach longer than this on the island [15]. If you want to know, it's exactly two and a half kilometres long and that's a bonus because it means it never gets overcrowded. It has golden sand and clear, blue water shelving into the sea. There are several beach restaurants to choose from and watersports are available when the water is calm. But check first. This beach operates a flag system [16] as the sea can get rough and you should always swim between the flags. There's a large car park which gives you easy access to the eastern end of the beach but the western end is much quieter and more wild as it is harder to reach. Blanaka is another popular beach — just in the north-west corner of the island [17]. It has incredibly white sand and sparkling water. There is ample car parking here and plenty of bars and restaurants. Blanaka has white cliffs all around it [18] and for those of you who'd like a little more to do than just lazing on the beach, there are caves here which you can explore in the cliffs and you can also dive into the water from rock platforms along the side of the cove. Well, my final recommendation for today is Dissidor. Now this beach isn't quite as easy to get to as the others I've talked about. It's quite a remote little beach tucked away here next to Blanaka. You can reach Dissidor by a steep slope which goes over some sandbanks [19] . The beach itself is small and pretty, with reddish-coloured sand and some stony areas on its eastern side. Despite being quite small the bathing is good and you can also go fishing here from the rocks at either side. It's a good idea to take some food and drink with you [20] if you decide to go here as there's only one little bar which isn't always open.\", 'Question_Type': 'T001'}]}, 'Part 3': {'Subparts': [{'Questions': ['Procedure for Bookshops\\n› Keep database of course/college details.\\n› In May, request 21 __________ from lecturers', '› Categorise books as:\\n— essential reading\\n— 22 __________ reading\\n— background reading', \"When ordering, refer to:\\n— last year's 23 __________\\n— type of course\\n— students' 24 __________\\n— own judgement\", 'Procedure for Publishers\\n› Send 25 __________ to course providers\\n› Use websites\\n› Compose personal 26 __________ to academic staff\\n› Send 27 __________ to bookstores', 'Students\\nMain objective is to find books that are good 28 __________\\nAlso look for books that are 29 __________ and 30 __________'], 'Answers': ['(course) booklists/reading list(s)', 'recommended', 'sales figures', 'year (group)', 'catalogue(s)', 'letters/correspondence', 'inspection/free copies', 'value (for money)', 'clear/easy to use', 'easy to use/clear'], 'Transcript': \"Announcer: The start of a new academic year is a challenge for booksellers. Lee Rogers talks to one major book store manager. Lee: Jenny Farrow, you're the manager of Dalton Books - and you sell an awful lot of books to students, don't you? Jenny: Yes! We do. Lee: How do you manage to make sure that you're going to have the books students need when all the new courses begin? Jenny: Basically, we make preparations long before they arrive. Like all other major book retailers, we have a database of information, and using that, we contact course conveners in May and ask them to send us their booklists [21]. Lee: How many books are we talking about? Jenny: For one course? Lee: Yes, as an example. Jenny: An average course requires about 30 books. We ask lecturers to indicate whether a book is what we call 'essential' reading... you know, the students simply have to get it, or whether it's what they would term 'recommended' reading [22]or whether it's just a supplementary text that they tend to refer to as 'background' reading. Lee: What about predicted buyers? Jenny: It's not a perfect system unfortunately. If a lecturer tells us that he expects us to sell 100 copies of a book, we know that we could actually sell anything from 50 to 150. That's why in practice, when it comes to ordering, it's a lot safer to go by the previous year's sales figures [23] - if that's possible of course... if we've sold the book before. We also build other factors into the equation including the type of course that the books are for, the students' year group [24] and a measure of our own judgement. Lee: And these criteria make a fairly accurate guide? Jenny: As accurate as we can be, yes. Lee: What about the publishers? Do they take an active role in promoting new books? Jenny: Certainly. The academic and professional publishing market is worth about ?700 million a year, so publishers go to some lengths to make sure their books are known. The standard procedure they use is to mail out catalogues to lecturers or colleges and universities [25], that's been the main form of promotion for years. Now, of course, they can also post details of new or revised works on websites. Some even go so far as writing individual letters to the appropriate lecturers [26] in order to let them know what's coming up. Lee: The lecturers then contact you if they're interested ... Jenny: That's right. The publishers send us - the book sellers - 'inspection copies' [27]. Lecturers can then get a free copy and decide whether it's going to be suitable for their course. Lee: And how does it work with the students? What are they looking for and who helps them most? Jenny: I think lecturers are best placed to understand the students' needs. Often the critical issue is what represents value for money for students [28]. This is more important than price per se. Lee: Do students actually buy books before they start the course? Jenny: Apparently a large proportion of students wait to see what they need. Students have a firm idea of what constitutes a good book so they tend to give themselves time to look at all the options before making a choice. They tend to go for books that are clear and easy to use [29,30] . Often the texts that their lecturers recommend turn out to be too academic and remain here on our shelves.\", 'Question_Type': 'T011'}]}, 'Part 4': {'Subparts': [{'Questions': ['31.

However, when you leave college you find yourself saying things like 'I'll have one more cup of coffee and then I'll sit down to work'. I hate to admit it but I say it myself.

I was a painter but I started to dabble in illustration, drawing pictures for books, cards, and this offered me the opportunity to become more emotionally detached from my work [34 - she wasn't subjective (emotional) anymore, therefore she became more objective]. I was no longer producing images from the heart but developing images for a specified subject, taking a more practical approach . I began to develop a collection of my illustrations which I put into a portfolio and started to carry around with me to show prospective clients and employers. But it was still tricky because publishers, for example, want to know that your drawings will reproduce well in a book, but without having had any work published, it's hard to prove this [35]. Having a wonderful portfolio or collection of original artwork is, of course, a first step but what most potential clients would like to see is printed artwork and without this 'evidence' they tend to hold back still when it comes to offering a contract .\", 'Question_Type': 'T007'}, {'Questions': ['Suggestions for Developing a Portfolio\\nGet some artwork printed in magazines by entering 36 __________.', 'You can also 37 __________ mock up book pages.', 'Make an effort to use a variety of artistic 38 __________.', 'Aim for recognition by dividing work into distinct 39 __________.', 'Possibly use 40 __________.'], 'Answers': ['(a) competition(s)', 'design and print', 'styles/techniques', 'categories', 'two/2 names'], 'Transcript': \"Well, I overcame this problem in two ways. And I suppose this is my advice to you on preparing your portfolio of your best work. The first way was by submitting my work for a competition [36], and the one I chose was for a horoscope design and was sponsored by a top women's magazine. There are a few of these competitions each year and they offer new illustrators an opportunity to showcase their work. The other approach I took was to design and print some mock-up pages of a book [37]. In other words, I placed some of my illustrations next to some text in order to demonstrate how my work would look when it was printed. Perhaps I was lucky in that I had taken a degree that provided me with all-round creative skills so that I could vary my style and wasn't limited to a certain technique [38]. I think that is important. The art world, and many other creative fields, do try to pigeon-hole people into snug boxes with an accompanying label. I think you should try to resist this if you feel it happening to you. If you don't, you'll find it difficult to have new work accepted if you try to develop your style at a later stage in your career. Nevertheless, when you start out and particularly when you're going for an interview, it's important not to confuse people by having a lot of different examples in your portfolio. One remedy for this is to separate your work into distinct categories [39]. In my case, I did this by dividing my design-inspired illustrations from my paintings. It is then easier to analyse the market suited to each portfolio; such as magazines, book jackets, CD covers etc. Working under two names is also useful [40] as it clarifies the different approaches and offers a distinction between them.\", 'Question_Type': 'T011'}]}}\n",

My job is to tell you all about the amazing little kiwi - and your job, hopefully, is to dig deep in your pockets.\\nNow for the benefit of our overseas visitors here today, I should explain first of all that the kiwi is the national bird of New Zealand - and sometimes New Zealanders themselves are known as 'Kiwis'. Now, while kiwis in the wild are a rare sight, the kiwi as a symbol is far more visible. Apart from being in toy stores and airport shops all over the world, you'll find them on our stamps and coins [11]. The kiwi is the smallest member of the genus Apteryx which also includes ostriches and emu. It gets its name from its shrill call [12] which sounds very much like this - kee-wee. Kiwis live in forests or swamps and feed on insects, worms, snails and berries. It's a nocturnal bird with limited sight and therefore it has to rely on its very keen sense of smell [13] to find food and to sense danger. Its nostrils are actually right on the end of its long beak which is one third of the body length. Now here's an interesting fact. Although kiwis have wings, they serve little purpose because the kiwi is a flightless bird [14].\\nSince white settlement of the islands, kiwi numbers have dropped from 12 million to less than 70,000 and our national bird is rapidly becoming an endangered species. This is because they're being threatened by what we call introduced animals animals [15] which were brought to New Zealand such as cats and ferrets which eat kiwi eggs and their chicks.\"}, {'Questions': ['16 _________', '17 _________'], 'Answers': ['(scientific) research', 'global education'], 'Transcript': 'And so we have launched the Kiwi Recovery Programme; in an all-out effort to save our national bird from extinction.

Then secondly we have the action stage. This is where we go into the field and actually put our knowledge to work - we call this putting science into practice, and then we come to the third stage - the global education stage [17].

This is the tricky part because it can be very difficult to find the eggs. Then, in safe surroundings, away from predators the chicks are reared [19] . Now this can be done on predator-free islands or in captivity - they're reared until they are about nine months old at which stage the chicks are returned to the wild. So far it's proving successful and since we started the programme some 34 chicks have been successfully raised this year and their chances of survival have increased from 5 to 85% [20]. However, it's not time to celebrate kiwi survival just yet. About 95% of kiwi chicks still don't make it to six months of age without protection.

But do super highways automatically lead to super wealth, as our politicians would have us believe? I think not.\\nTutor: Can you give us an example of what you mean exactly?\\nProfessor: Sure. Well, by continuing to encourage this dependence on the motor car, we simply create more congestion and more urban sprawl [21].

I think it's great.\\nProfessor: Ah yes, but it cost 2 billion dollars to build, and you could have gotten ten times the value by putting the money into public transport. If you give the automobile road space, it will fill that space, and you'll soon find you'll be crawling along your City Link [23].\\nTutor: But surely, you cannot simply blame the car. Some of the blame must rest with governments and city planners?\\nStudent: Well there is an argument, surely, that building good roads is actually beneficial because most new cars these days are highly efficient - they use far less petrol than in the past and emissions of dangerous gases are low [24]. Old congested roads, on the other hand, encourage traffic to move slowly and it's the stationary cars that cause the pollution and smog, whereas good roads increase traffic speeds and thus the amount of time cars are actually on the roads.\\nProfessor: Well... this is the old argument put forward by the road lobby but, for me it's clear cut.

Well, apart from keeping it fresh for our daily needs, many foods, such as fruit and vegetables are only available at certain times of the year so if we want to be able to eat these foods all year round, we need to preserve them. We also need to preserve food for export overseas to make sure that it doesn't perish in transit [31], and lastly we need to be able to preserve food for when there are food shortages [32]. There are a number of methods of preserving food which involve both high and low temperatures, chemicals, irradiation and drying. Let's have a look at these in turn.\"}, {'Questions': ['33 __________', '34 __________', '35 __________', '36 __________', '37 __________'], 'Answers': ['lasts longer/lasts much longer', 'food-poisoning/poisoning', 'electricity/electricity supply/supply of electricity/power', 'chemical preservation/add (adding) chemicals/using chemicals', 'cheap to store'], 'Transcript': \"In the 1870s the French scientist, Louis Pasteur, showed that micro-organisms in food could be destroyed by raising the temperature of the food - a process now known as pasteurisation. This involves heating milk to just 65°C for 30 minutes. A new method, the ultra-high temperature or UHT process, involves heating milk to 150°C for three seconds. The advantage of treating milk in this way is that it lasts much longer [33] though I tend to feel, and I'm sure many of you would agree, that taste is somewhat sacrificed in the UHT process.\\nTin cans were first used in the early 1800s to store and preserve food. Just as they are now, the cans were tin-plated, steel containers and the process had the advantage of being cost effective. Unfortunately, however, there were many early cases of food-poisoning [34] because the canning process was not fully understood at that stage. We now know the exact temperature and length of time each food needs for proper preservation which has greatly reduced the risk of food-poisoning.\\nPeople living in cold climates often preserved food by burying it in the snow and the Romans knew all about the advantages of packing food in ice but for most people this was not an option until the invention of the refrigerator in 1834. Today, however, refrigeration is the most important means of preserving food because the food stays fresh without needing to be treated. However, refrigeration requires an electricity supply and unfortunately if the power goes off, so does the food [35]!\\nA variety of chemicals can be added to food and you'll find their names listed on the labels of cans and bottles. Salt is probably the oldest of all the chemical preservatives and was used by many ancient civilisations for many years.\\nSugar also acts as a preservative and is used to preserve jams in much the same way that vinegar is used to pickle foods. Chemical preservatives are effective but they do not suit all foods and the processes involved are time- consuming.\\nAnother method of preserving food is by drying it. Most foods are 75% to 90% water so if you remove the water the micro-organisms simply can't survive. When food is dried it not only lasts a long time but it also becomes much lighter which is a big advantage as this makes it cheap to store [36], though some people argue that valuable nutrients are lost in the process. Early methods for drying food involved cutting it into strips and hanging it in the sun or over fires. But there are now a number of more modern methods which involve the use of recent technology. One of these is known as roller drying and it's a highly effective way of making dried foods from liquids, such as soup.\"}, {'Questions': ['38 __________', '39 __________', '40 __________'], 'Answers': ['(hot) soup', '(heated) belt', 'dry powder'], 'Transcript': 'Have a look at this diagram to see how it works. Well, first of all the hot soup is poured in at one end [38] — here. The liquid spreads to form a thin layer on a heated belt [39]. The liquid dries as it moves along. By the time it reaches the end of the belt, all the water has evaporated leaving only dry powder [40]. A blade then scrapes the dried material off the roller and captures it in powder form . All you have to do is add boiling water and you have your hot soup back again, ready to drink!'}]}}\n",

Perhaps the most well known of working dogs is the border collie sheep dog. Sheep dogs which work in unison with their masters need to be smart and obedient with a natural ability to herd sheep. Some farmers say that their dogs are so smart that they not only herd sheep, they can count them [13], too! Another much-loved working dog is the guide dog, trained to work with the blind. Guide dogs, usually Labradors, need to be confident enough to lead their owner through traffic and crowds but they must also be of a gentle nature [14]. It costs a great deal of money to train a dog for this very valuable work but the Guide Dog Associations in the UK, America and Australia receive no government assistance so all the money comes from donations [15]. Another common breed of work dog is the German shepherd. German shepherds make excellent guard dogs and are also very appropriate as search and rescue [16] dogs working in disaster zones after earthquakes and avalanches. These dogs must be tough and courageous to cope with the arduous conditions of their work. And so that they can be sent anywhere in the world to assist in disaster relief operations, effective dogs and their trainers are now listed on an international database [17]. When you arrive at an airport here in Australia, you may be greeted in the baggage hall by a detector dog, wearing a little red coat bearing the words 'Quarantine'. These dogs are trained to sniff out fresh fruit as well as meat and even live animals hidden in people's bags. In order to be effective, a good detector dog must have an enormous food drive - in other words they must really love their food [18]. At Sydney airport where there are ten detector dogs working full time, they stop about 80 people a month [19] trying to bring illegal goods into the country. And according to their trainers, they very rarely get it wrong! Another famous working dog is the husky. Huskies, which originally came from Siberia, have been used for decades as a means of transport on snow, particularly in Antarctica where they have played an important role. Huskies are well adapted to harsh conditions and they enjoy working in a team [20]. But the huskies have all left Antarctica now because the International Treaty prohibits their use in the territory as they are not native animals. Many people were sad to see the dogs leave Antarctica as they had been vital to the early expeditions and earned their place in history along with the explorers.\", 'Question_Type': 'T001'}]}, 'Part 3': {'Subparts': [{'Questions': ['Louis Braille was blinded as a child in his 21 __________', 'Braille invented the writing system in the year 22 __________', 'A military system using dots was called 23 __________'], 'Answers': [\"father's workshop\", '1824', 'night writing'], 'Transcript': \"Chairman: We're very pleased to welcome to our special interest group today, Dr. Linda Graycar who is from the City Institute for the Blind. Linda is going to talk to us about the system of writing for the blind known as Braille. Linda, welcome. Dr. Graycar: Thank you. Chairman: Now we'd like to keep this session pretty informal, and I know Linda won't mind if members of the group want to ask questions as we go along. Let's start with an obvious one. What is Braille and where does it get its name from? Dr. Graycar: Well, as you said, Braille is a system of writing used by and for people who cannot see. It gets its name from the man who invented it, the Frenchman Louis Braille who lived in the early 19th century. Chairman: Was Louis Braille actually blind himself? Dr. Graycar: Well... he wasn't born blind, but he lost his sight at the age of three as the result of an accident in his father's workshop [21]. Louis Braille then went to Paris to the National Institute for Blind Children and that's where he invented his writing system at the age of only 15 in 1824 [22] while he was at the Institute. Chairman: But he wasn't the first person to invent a system of touch reading for the blind, was he? Dr. Graycar: No - another Frenchman had already come up with the idea of printing embossed letters that stood out from the paper but this was very cumbersome and inefficient. Chairman: Did Louis Braille base his system on this first one? Dr. Graycar: No, not really. When he first went to Paris he heard about a military system of writing using twelve dots. This was a system invented by an enterprising French army officer and it was known as 'night writing' [23] It wasn't meant for the blind, but rather for battle communications at night.\", 'Question_Type': 'T009'}, {'Questions': ['24.

Dr. Graycar: Anyway, Braille took this system as a starting point but instead of using the twelve dots which 'night writing' used, he cut the number of dots in half and developed a six-dot system. Chairman: Can you give us a little more information about how it works? Dr. Graycar: Well, it's a system of touch reading which uses an arrangement of raised dots called a cell. Braille numbered the dot positions 1-2-3 downward on the left and 4-5-6 downward on the right [24] . The letters of the alphabet are then formed by using different combinations of these dots. Student: So is the writing system based on the alphabet with each word being individually spelt out? Dr. Graycar: Well ... it's not quite that simple, I'm afraid! For instance, the first 10 letters of the alphabet are formed using dots 1, 2, 4 and 5. But Braille also has its own short forms for common words [25]. For example, 'b' for the word 'but' and 'h' for 'have' - there are many other contractions like this. Chairman: So you spell out most words letter by letter, but you use short forms for common words [25]. Dr. Graycar: Yes. Though, I think that makes it sound a little easier than it actually is! Chairman: And was it immediately accepted? I mean, did it catch on straight away? Dr. Graycar: Well, yes and no! It was immediately accepted and used by Braille's fellow students at the school but the system was not officially adopted until 1854, two years after Braille's death [26]. So, official acceptance was slow in coming! Student: I suppose it works for all languages which use the roman alphabet? Dr. Graycar: Yes, it does, with adaptations, of course. Student: Can it be written by hand or do you need a machine to produce Braille? Dr. Graycar: Well, you can write it by hand on to paper with a device called a slate and stylus but the trick is that you have to write backwards [27], for example from right to left so that then when you turn your sheet over, the dots face upwards and can be read like English from left to right.\", 'Question_Type': 'T007'}, {'Questions': ['List THREE subjects that also use a Braille code.\\n28 __________', '29 __________', '30 __________'], 'Answers': ['mathematics/maths', 'science', 'music'], 'Transcript': \"Student: Oh, I see.

Dr. Graycar: Yes, indeed. In addition to the literary Braille code, as it's known, which of course includes English and French, there are other codes. For instance, in 1965 they created a form of Braille for Mathematics [28]. Student: I can’t, imagine trying to do maths in Braille! Dr. Graycar: Yes, that does sound difficult, I agree.

Our memories, it's true to say, work very differently depending upon whether we are very old, very young or somewhere in the middle. But when exactly do we start to remember things and how much can we recall? One of the first questions that we might ask is - do babies have any kind of episodic memory, can they remember particular events [31]? Obviously, we can't ask them, so how do we find out? Well, one experiment that's been used has produced some interesting results. It's quite simple and involves a baby, in its cot, a colourful mobile and a piece of string [32]. It works like this. If you suspend the mobile above the cot and connect the baby's foot to it with the string the mobile will move every time the baby kicks. Now you can allow time for the baby to learn what happens and enjoy the activity. Then you remove the mobile for a time and re-introduce it some time from one to fourteen days later [33]. If you look at this table of results, at the top two rows you can see that what is observed shows that two-month-old babies can remember the trick for up to two days and three-month-old babies for up to a fortnight [34]. And although babies trained on one mobile will respond only if you use the familiar mobile, if you train them on a variety of colours and designs, they will happily respond to each one in turn. Now, looking at the third row on the table, you will see that when they learn to speak, babies as young as 21 months demonstrate an ability to remember events which happened several weeks earlier. And by the time they are two, some children's memories will stretch back over six months [35], though their recall will be random, with little distinction between key events and trivial ones and very few of these memories, if any, will survive into later life. So we can conclude from this that even very tiny babies are capable of grasping and remembering a concept.\", 'Question_Type': 'T011'}, {'Questions': ['Research questions: Is memory linked to 36 __________ development?', 'Can babies 37 __________ their memories?', 'Stages in incident:\\na. lecture taking place\\nb. object falls over\\nc. 38 __________', 'Age\\n% remembered next \\nday\\n% remembered after 5 months\\nAdults\\n70%\\n39 __________', 'Age\\n% remembered next \\nday\\n% remembered after 5 months\\n6-year-\\nolds\\nJust under 70%\\n40 __________'], 'Answers': ['language', 'retrieve/recall/recover', '(an) argument', '70%', '40%'], 'Transcript': \"So how is it that young infants can suddenly remember for a considerably longer period of time? Well, one theory accounting for all of this - and this relates to the next question we might ask - is that memory develops with language [36] . Very young children with limited vocabularies are not good at organising their thoughts. Though they may be capable of storing memories, do they have the ability to retrieve them [37]? One expert has suggested an analogy with books on a library shelf. With infants, he says, 'it is as if early books are hard to find because they were acquired before the cataloguing system was developed'. But even older children forget far more quickly than adults do. In another experiment, several six-year-olds, nine-year-olds and adults were shown a staged incident. In other words, they all watched what they thought was a natural sequence of events. The incident went like this: a lecture which they were listening to was suddenly interrupted by something accidentally overturning, in this case it was a slide projector. To add a third stage and make the recall more demanding, this 'accident' was then followed by an argument [38]. In a memory test the following day, the adults and the nine-year-olds scored an average 70% [39] and the six- year-olds did only slightly worse. In a retest five months later, the pattern was very different. The adults' memory recall hadn't changed but the nine-year-olds' had slipped to less than 60% and the six-year-olds could manage little better than 40% recall [40].\", 'Question_Type': 'T009'}]}}\n",
