    "Transcript": "A Good morning. Packham’s Shipping Agents. Can I help you? \nB Oh yes, I’m ringing to make enquiries about sending a large box, a container, \nback home to Kenya from the UK. \nA Yes, of course. Would you like me to try and find some quotations for you? \nB Yes, that’d be great. Thank you. \nA Well first of all, I need a few details from you. \nB Fine. \nA Can I take your name? \nB It’s Jacob Mkere. \nA Can you spell your surname, please? \nB Yes, it’s M-K-E-R-E. \nA Is that ‘M’ for mother? \nB Yes. \nA Thank you, and you say that you will be sending the box to Kenya? \nB That’s right. \nA And where would you like the box picked up from? \nB From college, if possible. \nA Yes, of course. I’ll take down the address now. \nB It’s Westall College. \nA Is that W-E-S-T-A-L-L? \nB Yes, ... college. \nA Westall College. And where’s that? \nB It’s Downlands Road, in Bristol. \nA Oh yes, I know it. And the postcode? \nB It’s BS8 9PU. \nA Right ... and I need to know the size. \nB Yes, I’ve measured it carefully and it’s 1.5m long ... \nA Right. \nB 0.75m wide ... \nA OK. \nB And it’s 0.5m high or deep. \nA Great. So I’ll calculate the volume in a moment and get some quotes for that. \nBut first can you tell me, you know, very generally, what will be in the box? \nB Yes there’s mostly clothes. \nA OK. [writing down] \nB And there’s some books. \nA OK. Good. Um ... Anything else? \nB Yes, there’s also some toys. \nA OK and what is the total value, do you think, of the contents? \nB Well the main costs are the clothes and the books – they’ll be about £1500 but \nthen the toys are about another two hundred – so I’d put down £1700."

There’s really three rates according to quality of insurance cover \n– there’s the highest comprehensive cover which is Premium rate, then there’s \nStandard rate and then there’s Economy rate.

    "Transcript": "Good evening, and welcome to the British Council. My name is John Parker and I’ve \nbeen asked to talk to you briefly about certain aspects of life in the UK before you \nactually go there. So I'm going to talk first about the best ways of making social \ncontacts there. Now you might be wondering why it should be necessary. After all, \nwe meet people all the time. But when you’re living in a foreign country it can be \nmore difficult, not just because of the language, but because customs may be \ndifferent. \n\nIf you’re going to work in the UK you will probably be living in private \naccommodation, so it won’t be quite so easy to meet people. But there are still things \nthat you can do to help yourself. First of all, you can get involved in activities in your \nlocal community, join a group of some kind. For example, you’ll probably find that \nthere are theatre groups who might be looking for actors, set designers and so on, or \nif you play an instrument you could join music groups in your area. Or if you like the \nidea of finding out about local history there’ll be a group for that too. These are just \nexamples. And the best places to get information about things like this are either the \ntown hall or the public library. Libraries in the UK perform quite a broad range of \nfunctions nowadays – they’re not just confined to lending books, although that’s their \nmain role of course."

    "Answer": "27 motivation\n28 time(-)management\n29 modules\n30 summer school(s)",
    "Transcript": "Rachel Well it took me a while to get used to it. I found I needed to maintain a \nhigh level of motivation, because it’s so different from school. There’s no- one saying, ‘Why haven’t you written your assignment yet?' and that sort \nof thing. \nRachel You’ll learn it, Paul. Another thing was that I got very good at time- management because I had to fit time for studying round a full-time job. \nRachel What makes it easier is that the degree is made up of modules, so you can \ntake time off between them if you need to. It isn’t like a traditional three- or four-year course, where you’ve got to do the whole thing of it in one go. \nRachel Huh, it’s all right for some. Then even though you’re mostly studying at \nhome, remember you’ve got tutors to help you, and from time to time \nthere are summer schools. They usually last a week. They’re great, \nbecause you meet all the other people struggling with the same things as \nyou. I’ve made some really good friends that way."

    "Transcript": "Official Well, there are two central hotels in the range you're looking for – there's \nCarlton House and The Imperial, they're both near the main square, but if \nyou've got your own transport you might be interested in the Royal Oak – \nthat’s out in the country, about ten kilometres away, very peaceful. Then \nthere's the Bridge hotel and the Majestic – they're both in town but not in \nthe centre, they're out on the airport road.\nOfficial Well, they're both excellent hotels. If you want something with a bit of \ncharacter, Carlton House is quite unusual – it's a very old building that \nwas originally a large private house. It was bought by the Vannis chain \nand they completely refurbished it – they took their first guests just a few \nmonths ago but it's already got an excellent reputation.\nOfficial Or there's the Imperial, which is a much more modern building. \nThat also has its own gym and it also has internet connection and \nmeetings rooms – it's used for conferences and corporate events as well \nas private guests. That's five-star as well.\nOfficial No – the Royal Oak has an outdoor pool, which is lovely in the summer, \nbut the only hotel with an indoor pool is the Bridge Hotel."

Of course, it took a while for such a big project to get \nstarted, but it was planned in the 60s, built in the 70s and eventually opened to the \npublic in 1983.\nit’s run by the City Council. \nand as the Centre is open 363 days of the year\nIf you’re interested in classical music, then we recommend you go along to the \nNational on either Monday or Tuesday evening at 7.30 for a spectacular production \nof ‘The Magic Flute’ - probably the most popular of all Mozart’s operas. It’s in the \nGarden Hall\nFor those more interested in the cinema, you might like to see the new Canadian film \nwhich is showing on Wednesday evening at 8pm in Cinema 2. And that’s called ‘Three \nLives.’\ntickets cost just £4.50, which is a reduction on the \nusual price of £5.50.\nBut you can see the centre’s main attraction at the weekend, because on Saturday \nand Sunday, 11am to 10pm, they’re showing a wonderful new exhibition that hasn’t \nbeen seen anywhere else in Europe yet. It’s a collection of Chinese Art called ‘Faces of \nChina’ - that’s in Gallery 1"
